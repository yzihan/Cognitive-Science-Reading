abstract

>Recent findings provide increased understanding of how emotional arousal creates lasting memories. The findings are consistent with those of prior studies suggesting that the enhancement assessed in human subjects results from activation of adrenergic and glucocorticoid stress hormones. Additionally, fMRI imaging findings indicate that the
>enhancement is influenced by activation of the amygdala and its subsequent influences on other brain systems. Findings of recent animal studies using posttraining noradrenergic or
>optogenetic activation of the amygdala provide extensive evidence that the basolateral amygdala modulates memory consolidation by influencing neuroplasticity in downstream
>brain systems involved in processing different forms of memory. Activation of these systems helps to insure that emotionally significant experiences are well remembered.





### EmotionCheck: leveraging bodily signals and false feedback to regulate our emotions

https://doi.org/10.1145/2971648.2971752

abstract

> In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to help individuals regulate their emotions with mobile interventions that leverage the way we naturally react to our bodily signals. Previous studies demonstrate that the awareness of our bodily signals, such as our heart rate, directly influences the way we feel. By leveraging these findings we designed a wearable device to regulate user’s anxiety by providing a false feedback of a slow heart rate.

harmful emotion

>Emotions powerfully shape how we interact with the world around us. Most of the time our emotions serve us very well. In other situations emotions can harm more than help, such as when an individual ’freezes’ during a presentation or when a person is propelled to hit another during an episode of anger. In order to avoid these situations, we make efforts to regulate our emotions to make them helpful rather than harmful

### Enhancing human emotions with interoceptive technologies.

Abstract

> Historically, multiple theories have posited an active, causal role for perceived bodily states in the creation of human emotion. Recent evidence for embodied cognition, i.e. the role of the entire body in cognition, and support for models positing a key role of bodily homeostasis in the creation of consciousness, i.e. active inference, call for the test of causal rather than correlational links between changes in bodily state and changes in affective state. The controlled stimulation of body signals underlying human emotions and the constant feedback loop between actual and expected sensations during interoceptive processing allows for intervention on higher cognitive functioning. Somatosensory interfaces and emotion prosthesis modulating body perception and human emotions through interoceptive illusions offer new experimental and clinical tools for affective neuroscience. Here, we review challenges in the affective and interoceptive neurosciences, in the light of these novel technologies designed to open avenues for applied research and clinical intervention.

Some fundamental questions concerning the mechanisms underlying the relation between emotion and interoception still remain unanswered.

### Awe Versus Aww: The Effectiveness of Two Kinds of Positive Emotional Stimulation on Stress Reduction for Online Content Moderators

**Abstract**

> When people have the freedom to create and post content on the internet, particularly anonymously, they do not always respect the rules and regulations of the websites on which they post, leaving other unsuspecting users vulnerable to sexism, racism, threats, and other unacceptable content in their daily cyberspace diet. However, content moderators witness the worst of humanity on a daily basis in place of the average netizen. This takes its toll on moderators, causing stress, fatigue, and emotional distress akin to the symptomology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The goal of the present study was to explore whether adding positive stimuli to breaktimes-images of baby animals or beautiful, aweinspiring landscapes-could help reduce the negative side-effects of being a content moderator. To test this, we had over 300 experienced content moderators read and decide whether 200 fake text-based social media posts were acceptable or not for public consumption. Although we set out to test positive emotional stimulation, however, we actually found that it is the cumulative nature of the negative emotions that likely negates most of the effects of the intervention: the longer the person had practiced content moderation, the stronger their negative experience. Connections to compassion fatigue and how best to spend work breaks as a content moderator are discussed.

### Auggie: Encouraging Effortful Communication through Handcrafted Digital Experiences

**Abstract**

> Digital communication is often brisk and automated. From auto-completed messages to "likes," research has shown that such lightweight interactions can affect perceptions of authenticity and closeness. On the other hand, effort in relationships can forge emotional bonds by conveying a sense of caring and is essential in building and maintaining relationships. To explore effortful communication, we designed and evaluated Auggie, an iOS app that encourages partners to create digitally handcrafted Augmented Reality (AR) experiences for each other. Auggie is centered around crafting a 3D character with photos, animated movements, drawings, and audio for someone else. We conducted a two-week-long field study with 30 participants (15 pairs), who used Auggie with their partners remotely. Our qualitative findings show that Auggie participants engaged in meaningful effort through the handcrafting process, and felt closer to their partners, although the tool may not be appropriate in all situations. We discuss design implications and future directions for systems that encourage effortful communication.
