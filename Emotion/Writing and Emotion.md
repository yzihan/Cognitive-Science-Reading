github: https://github.com/SALT-NLP/positive-frames

Why Positive Frames?

>This work was inspired by the need to escape the negative patterns of thinking that began to overwhelm the authors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We realized that what we needed was not some naive belief that everything would be okay if we ignored our problems. Instead, we needed *reframing*, or a shift in focus, with less weight on the negative things we can't control, and more weight on the positive things about ourselves and our situation which we can control.
>
>*Positive reframing* induces a complementary positive viewpoint (e.g. glass-half-full), which nevertheless supports the underlying content of the original sentence (see diagram above). The reframe implicates rather than contradicts the source, and the transformation is motivated by theoretically justified strategies from positive psychology (see *What's 'in the box?'*).
>
>Our work shows how NLP can help lead the way by automatically reframing overly negative text using strategies from positive psychology.

abstract

> Sentiment transfer is one popular example of a text style transfer task, where the goal is to reverse the sentiment polarity of a text. With a sentiment reversal comes also a reversal in meaning. We introduce a different but related task called positive reframing in which we neutralize a negative point of view and generate a more positive perspective for the author without contradicting the original meaning. Our insistence on meaning preservation makes positive reframing a challenging and semantically rich task. To facilitate rapid progress, we introduce a large-scale benchmark, POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY FRAMES, with 8,349 sentence pairs and 12,755 structured annotations to explain positive reframing in terms of six theoreticallymotivated reframing strategies. Then we evaluate a set of state-of-the-art text style transfer models, and conclude by discussing key challenges and directions for future work. 

### Gratitude and depressive symptoms: The role of positive reframing and positive emotion.

abstract

>Eight studies (N=2,973) tested the theory that gratitude is related to fewer depressive symptoms through positive reframing and positive emotion. Study 1 found a direct path between gratitude and depressive symptoms. Studies 2-5 demonstrated that positive reframing mediated the relationship between gratitude and depressive symptoms. Studies 6-7 showed that positive emotion mediated the relationship between gratitude and depressive symptoms. Study 8 found that positive reframing and positive emotion simultaneously mediated the relationship between gratitude and depressive symptoms. In sum, these eight studies demonstrate that gratitude is related to fewer depressive symptoms, with positive reframing and positive emotion serving as mechanisms that account for this relationship.

### Benefits of expressive writing in lowering rumination and depressive symptoms

Abstract

> Depression-vulnerable college students (with both elevated prior depressive symptoms and low current depressive symptoms) wrote on 3 consecutive days in either an expressive writing or a control condition. As predicted, participants scoring above the median on the suppression scale of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Gross & John, 2003) showed significantly lower depression symptoms at the 6-month assessment when they wrote in the expressive writing versus the control condition. Additional analyses revealed that treatment benefits were mediated by changes in the Brooding but not the Reflection scale of the Ruminative Response Scale (Nolen-Hoeksema & Morrow, 1991). A "booster" writing session predicted to enhance treatment benefits failed to have a significant effect.

### Can the use of writing lower rumination of negative thoughts in depressed adults?

Abstract: 

> Background and aims: The results of James Pennebaker's 1993 study into the effect of writing on the health of college undergraduates showed significant improvements to the immune system and, subsequently, the writing model has been researched in a number of health care contexts with significant results. Pennebaker revised this model of writing (1997) and it has since been implemented by health professionals in the treatment of depression where negative, recurring thoughts are problematic, with positive outcomes. This review describes and compares two similar randomized control trials (RCTs) using the three day writing model for reducing ruminative thought in depressed adults. Methods: A systematic literature search was undertaken to elicit RCTs measuring the effect of using writing for people presenting with rumination in depression. Findings: Results showed that expressive writing moderated maladaptive ruminative styles of thinking and significantly reduced depressive symptoms at the follow-up assessment. The term 'rumination' is complex and relevant in the study of symptoms where depressed patients suffer with negative recurring thoughts. Conclusion: Pennebaker's writing method may be a useful tool for practitioners working in therapy and rehabilitation for adults suffering with depression with a tendency to ruminate. Further discussion and research within a mental health context are required.

### Expressive writing buffers against maladaptive rumination.

Abstract

> This study examined whether ruminative style moderated the effects of expressive writing. Sixty-nine participants were assessed for ruminative style and depression symptoms at the beginning of their 1st college semester. Participants were then randomized to either an expressive writing or a control writing condition. Changes in depression symptoms were assessed 2, 4, and 6 months later. Results showed that a brooding ruminative style moderated the effects of expressive writing such that among those assigned to the expressive writing condition, individuals with greater brooding scores reported significantly fewer depression symptoms at all of the follow-up assessments relative to individuals with lower brooding scores. In contrast, reflective pondering ruminative style did not moderate the effects of expressive writing on depression symptoms. These findings suggest that expressive writing could be used as a means of reducing depression symptoms among those with a maladaptive ruminative tendency to brood.

### Training Positive Rumination in Expressive Writing to Enhance Psychological Adjustment and Working Memory Updating for Maladaptive Ruminators

abstract

>Rumination is associated with psychological adjustment and working memory (WM) capacity. Studies have shown that psychological interventions can reduce negative rumination and improve psychological adjustment and WM capacity. The present study investigated the effect of positive rumination training in expressive writing on psychological adjustment and WM updating capacity. Within an experimental design, positive rumination was manipulated for 10 participants who were maladaptive ruminators in an experiment using a 5-week training compared to the control group with nine participants. Results revealed significant enhancement of psychological adjustment and the response time (RT) of WM updating in the experimental group but not in the control group. The two groups did not show significant difference of all the variables in pretest. However, the experimental group showed significantly better outcomes than the control group in posttest. The results suggest that positive rumination training in expressive writing is effective and rumination has a causal influence on WM updating capacity.

### NLG-Based Moderator Response Generator to Support Mental Health

CHI EA’15: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2702613.2732758

abstract

> The global need to effectively address mental health problems and wellbeing is well recognised. Today, online systems are increasingly being viewed as an effective solution for their ability to reach broad populations. As online support groups become popular the workload for human moderators increases. Maintaining quality feedback becomes increasingly challenging as the community grows. Tools that can automatically detect mental health problems from social media posts and then generate smart feedback can greatly reduce human overload. In this paper, we present a system for the automation of interventions using Natural Language Generation (NLG) techniques. In particular, we focus on 'depression' and 'anxiety' related interventions. Psychologists evaluated the quality of the systems' interventions and results were compared against human (i.e. moderator) interventions. Results indicate our intervention system still has a long way to go, but is a step in the right direction as a tool to assist human moderators with their service.



### HCI and Affective Health: Taking stock of a decade of studies and charting future research directions

CHI'19: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3300475

abstract

>In the last decade, the number of articles on HCI and health has increased dramatically. We extracted 139 papers on depression, anxiety and bipolar health issues from 10 years of SIGCHI conference proceedings. 72 of these were published in the last two years. A systematic analysis of this growing body of literature revealed that most innovation happens in automated diagnosis, and self-tracking, although there are innovative ideas in tangible interfaces. We noted an overemphasis on data production without consideration of how it leads to fruitful interventions. Moreover, we see a need to promote ethical practices for involvement of people living with affective disorders. Finally, although only 16 studies evaluate technologies in a clinical context, several forms of support and intervention illustrate how rich insights are gained from evaluations with real patients. Our findings highlight potential for growth in the design space of affective health technologies.



### Identifying Cognitive Distortion by Convolutional Neural Network based Text Classification

International Journal of Information Technology 2017

abstract

> Cognitive distortions have a way of playing havoc with our lives. The most important step to untwist the irrational thinking is identifying the forms of the cognitive distortion. The daily narration or diaries of the patients are always used by the cognitive-behavioral therapists as a clue to identify the cognitive distortion. But these natural language materials are always diverse and desultory which affect the efficiency and accuracy of identification. In this research, we propose a model called ICODLE (Identifying Cognitive Distortion by Deep Learning) which utilizes the daily narration or diaries of the patients to identify the forms of the cognitive distortion. ICODLE collect the daily narration and diaries from the authoritative books and webpages in CBT (Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy) domain. Then ICODLE creates the database of the 10 forms of cognitive distortion which were defined by David D. Burns. By utilizing the advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., Word Embedding, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), etc.), ICODLE can identify the forms of the patients' cognitive distortions without the features extraction. ICODLE can effectively assist the patients and the cognitive-behavioral therapists to diagnose the cognitive distortions. ICODLE also benefit to build up the online persuasion system.



### Automatic Detection and Classification of Cognitive Distortions in Mental Health Text

>In cognitive psychology, automatic and self reinforcing irrational thought patterns are known as cognitive distortions. Left unchecked, patients exhibiting these types of thoughts can become stuck in negative feedback loops of unhealthy thinking, leading to inaccurate perceptions of reality commonly associated with anxiety and depression. In this paper, we present a machine learning framework for the automatic detection and classification of 15 common cognitive distortions in two novel mental health free text datasets collected from both crowdsourcing and a real-world online therapy program. When differentiating between distorted and non-distorted passages, our modelachieved a weighted F1 score of 0.88. For classifying distorted passages into one of 15 distortion categories, our model yielded weighted F1 scores of 0.68 in the larger crowdsourced dataset and 0.45 in the smaller online counseling dataset, both of which outperformed random baseline metrics by a large margin. For both tasks, we also identified the most discriminative words and phrases between classes to highlight common thematic elements for improving targeted and therapist-guided mental health treatment. Furthermore, we performed an exploratory analysis using unsupervised content-based clustering and topic modeling algorithms as first efforts towards a data-driven perspective on the thematic relationship between similar cognitive distortions traditionally deemed unique. Finally, we highlight the difficulties in applying mental health-based machine learning in a real-world setting and comment on the implications and benefits of our framework for improving automated delivery of therapeutic treatment in conjunction with traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy.



### A Weakly Supervised Learning Framework for Detecting Social Anxiety and Depression

IMWUT 2018: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3214284

abstract

> Although social anxiety and depression are common, they are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, in part due to difficulties identifying and accessing individuals in need of services. Current assessments rely on client self-report and clinician judgment, which are vulnerable to social desirability and other subjective biases. Identifying objective, nonburdensome markers of these mental health problems, such as features of speech, could help advance assessment, prevention, and treatment approaches. Prior research examining speech detection methods has focused on fully supervised learning approaches employing strongly labeled data. However, strong labeling of individuals high in symptoms or state affect in speech audio data is impractical**,** in part because it is not possible to identify with high confidence which regions of a long speech indicate the person's symptoms or affective state. We propose a weakly supervised learning framework for detecting social anxiety and depression from long audio clips. Specifically, we present a novel feature modeling technique named NN2Vec that identifies and exploits the inherent relationship between speakers' vocal states and symptoms/affective states. Detecting speakers high in social anxiety or depression symptoms using NN2Vec features achieves F-1 scores 17% and 13% higher than those of the best available baselines. In addition, we present a new multiple instance learning adaptation of a BLSTM classifier, named BLSTM-MIL. Our novel framework of using NN2Vec features with the BLSTM-MIL classifier achieves F-1 scores of 90.1% and 85.44% in detecting speakers high in social anxiety and depression symptoms.



### Multimodal Analysis and Estimation of Intimate Self-Disclosure

**ICMI 19 Best Paper**

abstract

> Self-disclosure to others has a proven benefit for one’s mental health. It is shown that disclosure to computers can be similarly beneficial for emotional and psychological well-being. In this paper, we analyzed verbal and nonverbal behavior associated with self-disclosure in two datasets containing structured human-human and human-agent interviews from more than 200 participants. Correlation analysis of verbal and nonverbal behavior revealed that linguistic features such as affective and cognitive content in verbal behavior, and nonverbal behavior such as head gestures are associated with intimate self-disclosure. A multimodal deep neural network was developed to automatically estimate the level of intimate self-disclosure from verbal and nonverbal behavior. Between modalities, verbal behavior was the best modality for estimating self-disclosure within-corpora achieving r = 0.66. However, the cross-corpus evaluation demonstrated that nonverbal behavior can outperform language modality in cross-corpus evaluation. Such automatic models can be deployed in interactive virtual agents or social robots to evaluate rapport and guide their conversational strategy.https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3340555.3353737

comments

> 1) this paper also provides some sample questions to ask, may be useful for the our pop-out questions as well.
> 2) People may be worry about the problem of privacy. But self-disclosure has a proven benefit for one’s mental health.



### Benefits of Expressive Writing in Lowering Rumination and Depressive Symptoms

### Gmail Smart Compose: Real-Time Assisted Writing

KDD’19: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292500.3330723

abstract

> In this paper, we present Smart Compose, a novel system for generating interactive, real-time suggestions in Gmail that assists users in writing mails by reducing repetitive typing. In the design and deployment of such a large-scale and complicated system, we faced several challenges including model selection, performance evaluation, serving and other practical issues. At the core of Smart Compose is a large-scale neural language model. We leveraged state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for language model training which enabled high-quality suggestion prediction, and constructed novel serving infrastructure for high-throughput and real-time inference. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed system design and deployment approach. This system is currently being served in Gmail.



### Using Patient Writings in Psychotherapy: Review of Evidence for Expressive Writing and Cognitive Behavioral Writing Therapy

The American Journal of Psychiatry Residents’ Journal 

https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp-rj.2016.110302

> Expression of thoughts and emotions has been a core aspect of psychotherapy dating back to its creation. Over the years, this expression has taken multiple forms, from traditional use of talking to writing, art, and music. Alternative forms of expression—writing in particular—have the advantage of being able to reach populations that may otherwise be unwilling or unable to engage in traditional psychotherapy. Some individuals feel comfortable writing about things they would not feel comfortable talking about (1). In addition, writing provides the benefit of being inexpensive and portable and often results in a product people can share with others. Although writing has been used as a method of expression both in and out of psychotherapy for many years, Pennebaker was the first individual to systematically study the beneficial effects of writing with the development of expressive writing (2). Multiple therapies have incorporated writing since that time, including cognitive-behavioral writing therapy. The present article will review the evidence for expressive writing and cognitive-behavioral writing therapy.



### Hashtag Healthcare: From Tweets to Mental Health Journals Using Deep Transfer Learning

As the popularity of social media platforms continues to rise, an ever-increasing amount of human communication and self- expression takes place online. Most recent research has focused on mining social media for public user opinion about external entities such as product reviews or sentiment towards political news. However, less attention has been paid to analyzing users' internalized thoughts and emotions from a mental health perspective. In this paper, we quantify the semantic difference between public Tweets and private mental health journals used in online cognitive behavioral therapy. We will use deep transfer learning techniques for analyzing the semantic gap between the two domains. We show that for the task of emotional valence prediction, social media can be successfully harnessed to create more accurate, robust, and personalized mental health models. Our results suggest that the semantic gap between public and private self-expression is small, and that utilizing the abundance of available social media is one way to overcome the small sample sizes of mental health data, which are commonly limited by availability and privacy concerns. 



### An everyday activity as a treatment for depression: The benefits of expressive writing for people diagnosed with major depressive disorder

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3759583/pdf/nihms490745.pdf

> Background—The benefits of expressive writing have been well documented among severalpopulations, but particularly among those who report feelings of dysphoria. It is not known,however, if those diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) would also benefit fromexpressive writing.
>
> Methods—Forty people diagnosed with current MDD by the Structured Clinical Interview forDSM-IV participated in the study. On day 1 of testing, participants completed a series ofquestionnaires and cognitive tasks. Participants were then randomly assigned to either anexpressive writing condition in which they wrote for 20 min over three consecutive days abouttheir deepest thoughts and feelings surrounding an emotional event (n=20), or to a controlcondition (n=20) in which they wrote about non-emotional daily events each day. On day 5 oftesting, participants completed another series of questionnaires and cognitive measures. Thesemeasures were repeated again 4 weeks later.
>
> Results—People diagnosed with MDD in the expressive writing condition showed significantdecreases in depression scores (Beck Depression Inventory and Patient Health Questionnaire-9scores) immediately after the experimental manipulation (Day 5). These benefits persisted at the4-week follow-up.
>
> Limitations—Self-selected sample.
>
> Conclusions—This is the first study to demonstrate the efficacy of expressive writing amongpeople formally diagnosed with current MDD. These data suggest that expressive writing may bea useful supplement to existing interventions for depression.



### Automated computer-based feedback in expressive writing

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563212000052

> Previous studies indicate that **changing pronoun use** can moderate the health beneﬁts of expressive writing. Participants who change their pronoun use from essay to essay beneﬁt more from the exercise. The current experiment attempted to improve the expressive writing paradigm by altering subjects’ focus (speciﬁcally self- and other-related focus) through text-based instructions. The automated language based system was simple to implement, and it successfully changed participants’ pronoun use, but the intervention had no mood-related or subjective beneﬁts. While the automated intervention system has promise in guiding people’s natural writing, future research must address the broader question of the inherent links between language use and substantive psychological change.



### Event detection for exploring emotional upheavals of depressive people

SAC 19 Best Paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3297280.3297485

abstract

>Depression is a common illness that negatively affects how people feel, think, and act. It causes feelings of sadness and sleeping disorders. In serious cases, it leads to self-harm or suicide. Many researchers in computer science addressed the problem of depression detection. However, less research concerns the emotional upheaval of depressive people and investigates the reasons behind the depression. In this paper, a deep learning model is first constructed to automatically determine the negative sentiment degree for a Facebook post. The curves of emotional upheavals for depressive users are then generated. Based on the post contents, weather, and news data, relevant events are detected to infer the reasons of the negative emotions. A correlation analysis between the behavioral data of the depressive users on Facebook and their negative emotions is also conducted. The results of this study can not only provide a self-examination tool for depressive people, but also serve as a diagnostic assessment reference for medical personnel.



### Who is the "Human" in Human-Centered Machine Learning: The Case of Predicting Mental Health from Social Media

CSCW 2019 Honorable Mention: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359249

> "Human-centered machine learning” (HCML) combines human insights and domain expertise with data-driven predictions to answer societal questions. This area’s inherent interdisciplinarity causes tensions in the obligations researchers have to the humans whose data they use. This paper studies how scientific papers represent human research subjects in HCML. Using mental health status prediction on social media as a case study, we conduct thematic discourse analysis on 55 papers to examine these representations. We identify five discourses that weave a complex narrative of who the human subject is in this research: Disorder/Patient,Social Media, Scientific, Data/Machine Learning, and Person. We show how these five discourses create paradoxical subject and object representations of the human, which may inadvertently risk dehumanization. We also discuss the tensions and impacts of interdisciplinary research; the risks of this work to scientific rigor, online communities, and mental health; and guidelines for stronger HCML research in this nascent area.

>“**Human-centered machine learning**” (HCML) is a rising subfield of computer science (CS) that combines the expertise of data-driven predictions and outside domain knowledge to make headway on questions of societal importance. 
>
>Language is a driving force in how we conceptualize problems, include (or exclude) individuals from analysis, and encourage others to advocate for social change, as it dramatically impacts power dynamics and politics of oppression.

### Testing Waters, Sending Clues: Indirect Disclosures of Socially Stigmatized Experiences on Social Media

CSCW 2018: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274288

> **Indirect disclosure strategies** include hinting about an experience or a facet of one's identity or relaying information explicitly but through another person. These strategies lend themselves to sharing stigmatized or sensitive experiences such as a pregnancy loss, mental illness, or abuse. Drawing on interviews with women in the U.S. who use social media and experienced pregnancy loss, we investigated factors guiding indirect disclosure decisions on social media. Our findings include 1) a typology of indirect disclosure strategies based on content explicitness, original content creator, and content sharer, and 2) an examination of indirect disclosure decision factors related to the self, audience, platform affordances, and temporality. We identify how people **intentionally adapt social media and indirect disclosures to meet psychological (e.g., keeping a personal record) and social (e.g., feeling out the audience) needs associated with loss.** We discuss implications for design and research, including features that support disclosures through proxy, and relevance for algorithmic detection and intervention. CAUTION: This paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss.

### Motivating expressive writing with a text-to-sound application

CHI10: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1753326.1753618

**Writing about emotional experiences has been shown to have long-term physical and mental health benefits, but it also creates short-term discomfort. We designed a system to motivate expressive writing** by enhancing enjoyment and pleasure. Using automated language analysis, we designed a system that **maps sound onto categories of language resulting in a musical interpretation of expressive writing texts.** An experimental design compared the experience of 126 participants across musical and non-musical writing platforms Participants found the musical system to be more pleasurable.

### Acceptance-Enhanced Expressive Writing Prevents Symptoms in Participants with Low Initial Depression

Cognitive Therapy and Research, 2012

> Traditional expressive writing (EW) and EW augmented by emotion-acceptance instructions (EWEA) were compared to non-emotional control writing for their ability to forestall depression symptoms in undergraduates with high or low initial levels of depression symptomatology. EWEA instructions encouraged participants to take a more accepting, ‘‘emotion friendly’’ approach toward expressive writing, stressing the importance of ‘‘staying present’’ with difficult emotional experiences nonjudgmentally and with openness. Writing condition interacted significantly with initial depression such that at the 5-week posttest, EWEA was more beneficial than control writing for participants with low to mild initial depression symptoms (CESD\17) and EW was more beneficial than control writing for participants with very low initial depression symptoms (CESD \8). But for the EW condition, this effect was reversed such that participants in this condition with high initial depression (CESD [26) fared worse at posttest than those in the control group.
> The purpose of the present study was twofold: First, we sought to test the effectiveness of expressive writing instructions augmented with messages designed to enhance acceptance of emotional experience. In addition, we sought to gather information on the relative effectiveness of expressive writing with individuals experiencing low versus high levels of depression symptoms.

### The benefits of mindfulness-enhanced expressive writing among depression-vulnerable individuals

> improving self-compassion (a construct related to mindfulness) was not found to mediate the effects of treatment on depressive symptoms and rumination

### Expressive Writing

Expressive writing refers to the procedure of writing about emotionally upsetting experiences without paying attention to grammar or spelling ([Pennebaker and Beall, 1986](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B29)). Previous studies have shown inconsistent findings regarding its effect on psychological adjustment. For example, in a systematic review, [Riddle et al. (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B33) found a significant effect of expressive writing on reducing trauma and improving general psychological health for caregivers but no effect on changing their depression, anxiety, physical symptoms, quality of life, or burden. Relatedly, in a systematic review, [Lee et al. (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B19) found that expressive writing improved the quality of life for women with breast cancer, but did not reduce their negative emotions. They then pointed out the “importance of modifying the traditional expressive writing protocol to enhance its efficacy” (p. 99). Furthermore, in a recent meta-analysis, [Reinhold et al. (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B32) found no significant long-term effects of expressive writing on depressive symptoms. However, the higher number of sessions and the more specific writing topic produced larger effects. Therefore, they proposed that brief, self-directed expressive writing should not be considered as an effective method to decrease depressive symptoms in physically healthy adults and that future research should employ longer and counselor-directed expressive writing.

Regarding the effects of expressive writing on rumination, [Gortner et al. (2006)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B15) found that writing for 20 min on 3 consecutive days significantly reduced depression level 6 months later. This effect was mediated by changes of brooding. Relatedly, [Sloan et al. (2008)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B36) found that the same number of sessions significantly reduced depression 2, 4, and 6 months later. Brooding ruminative style moderated the effects of expressive writing such that participants with higher brooding scores reported significantly lower depression level relative to those with lower brooding scores. Recently, [Glass et al. (2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B14) found that a modified framework of expressive writing significantly reduced rumination for adults who had a trauma, or significant emotional/physical upheaval, within the past year.

These findings suggest that expressive writing could be modified to reduce negative rumination such as brooding.
