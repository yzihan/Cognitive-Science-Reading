doi: [10.5014/ajot.2021.046169](https://doi.org/10.5014%2Fajot.2021.046169)

Importance:

> Virtual reality in head-mounted displays (HMD-VR) may be a valuable tool in occupational therapy to address anxiety. Findings from the virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) literature may facilitate translation of HMD-VR to occupational therapy psychosocial practice.

Objective: 

> To explore how HMD-VR has been used to treat anxiety through VRET and could be translated to occupational therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance: 

> HMD-VR can be a valuable tool for occupational therapy to simulate environments where clients with anxiety disorders participate. Eliciting presence through multisensory features and body representation may enhance outcomes.

What This Article Adds: 

> Drawing from the VRET literature, this scoping review suggests that HMD-VR can be used by occupational therapy practitioners to simulate ecologically valid environments, evaluate client responses to fearful stimuli, and remediate anxiety though immersion in virtual tasks when participation in natural contexts is unfeasible. Having ecologically valid environments is particularly important for people with anxiety disorders because they need support to cope when they encounter triggers in everyday life environments.

The advantages of using VR

> A convenient and affordable alternative for enhancing patient outcomes is exposing patients to realistic simulations of these environments through immersive virtual reality (VR), which provides “artificially generated sensory information in a form that people perceive as similar to real-world objects or events” ([Wilson et al., 1997](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib49), p. 213).

> One approach that can be implemented in VR to treat anxiety is exposure therapy, which helps clients confront fear-inducing stimuli through guided exposures and is often paired with cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT; [American Psychological Association, Society of Clinical Psychology [APA-SCP\], 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib3a)). It is client-centered and facilitates habituation, extinction of associations with fearful stimuli, self-efficacy, emotional processing, and participation in life activities ([APA-SCP, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib3)). Exposure can take place in several forms: (1) in vivo exposure, in which clients face fear in real life; (2) imaginal exposure, in which clients vividly imagine the fear-evoking stimulus; and (3) interoceptive exposure, which replicates physiological signs of anxiety ([APA-SCP, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib3)).

> This therapy also has several forms of pacing, including (1) graded exposure, in which treatment progresses through a client’s fear hierarchy; (2) flooding, which begins with the most fearful stimulus; and (3) systematic desensitization, which includes relaxation techniques ([APA-SCP, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib3)).

> VR exposure therapy (VRET) is a more convenient and cost-effective form of exposure therapy that uses well-crafted virtual environments (VEs) to elicit the sense of anxiety and presence that the client would experience during real exposures ([Botella et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib9); [Motraghi et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib36)).

Implications for Occupational Therapy Practice

> HMD-VR is a safe, affordable, and effective tool that can allow occupational therapy practitioners to simulate natural contexts in the clinic for activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, and coping skills practice.

> HMD-VR interventions should include visual and auditory features to evoke a sense of presence, and other sensory features may not be necessary.

> VEs can be easily manipulated to optimize the congruence between the person and environment.


### Virtual reality exposure therapy in anxiety disorders: a quantitative meta-analysis.

doi: https://doi.org/10.1002/da.20910

1. VRET: Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is a promising intervention for the treatment of the anxiety disorders. 
2. Main objective: to compare the efficacy of VRET, used in a behavioral or cognitive-behavioral framework, with that of the classical evidence-based treatments, in anxiety disorders. 
3. Results:
(1) VRET does far better than the waitlist control; 
(2) the post-treatment results show similar efficacy between the behavioral and the cognitive behavioral interventions incorporating a virtual reality exposure component and the classical evidence-based interventions, with no virtual reality exposure component; 
(3) VRET has a powerful real-life impact, similar to that of the classical evidence-based treatments; 
(4) VRET has a good stability of results over time, similar to that of the classical evidence-based treatments; 
(5) there is a dose–response relationship for VRET;
(6) there is no difference in the dropout rate between the virtual reality exposure and the in vivo exposure.

### Affective outcomes of virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety and specific phobias: A meta-analysis.

doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbtep.2007.07.007

1. Topics covered: PTSD, social phobia, Arachnophobia, Acrophobia, Panic disorder with agoraphobia, Aviophobia
2. Conclusion: Given the currently available data, it appears that VRET is relatively effectivefrom a psychotherapeutic standpoint in carefully selected patients. VRET can reduceanxiety and phobia symptoms. Whether the affective enhancements are directlyrelated to VRET, or some other factor, remains to be speciﬁed, as do the clinicalpredictors for such improvements. The meta-analytic ﬁndings parallel qualitative reviewsrevealing that VRET has potential for the treatment of anxiety and several speciﬁcphobias.

## VR and mindfulness

### Inner Garden: Connecting Inner States to a Mixed Reality Sandbox for Mindfulness. 

doi: https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025743

**Abstract**

> Mindfulness, the act of paying a deliberate and non-judgmental attention to the present moment, has been shown to have a positive impact on a person’s health and subjective well-being – commonly called “happiness”. Based on an iterative process with meditation teachers and practitioners, we designed a new tool to support mindfulness practices. This tool takes the shape of an augmented sandbox, designed to inspire the user’s self-motivation and curiosity. By shaping the sand, the user creates a living miniature world that is projected back onto the sand. The natural elements of the garden are connected to real-time physiological measurements, such as breathing, helping the user to stay focused on the body. Moreover, using a Virtual Reality headset, they can travel inside their garden for a dedicated meditation session. Preliminary results seem to indicate that the system is well suited for mindfulness and induces a calm and mindful state on the user. The meditation teachers envisioned the use of Inner Garden in their practice.


### The Meditation Chamber: Towards Self-Modulation.

**Abstract**

> The Meditation Chamber is an immersive virtual environment (VE), initially created to enhance and augment the existing methods of training users how to meditate, and by extension, to realize the benefits from meditation practice, including the reduction of stress, anxiety and pain. Its innovative combination of immersive virtual reality (VR) and biofeedback technologies added interoceptive or dimensions of inner senses to the already sensorially rich affordances of VR. Because the Meditation Chamber enabled users to become aware of autonomic senses that they are not normally conscious of, and to manipulate them in real-time, we found that it did enhance users’ abilities to learn how to meditate, particularly those who had never meditated. We describe the Meditation Chamber, scientific methods of evaluation and findings, and discuss first-person phenomenological aspects, its long-term applicability for users who have chronic pain, and future directions.


### Sonic Cradle: Designing for an Immersive Experience of Meditation by Connecting Respiration to Music.

doi: https://doi.org/10.1145/2317956.2318017

**Abstract**
> Sonic Cradle is a chamber of complete darkness where users shape a peaceful soundscape using only their respiration. This interactive system was designed to foster a meditative experience by facilitating users' sense of immersion while following a specific attentional pattern characteristic of mindfulness. The goal of Sonic Cradle is twofold: first, to trigger the proven effects of mindfulness on stress, and second, to help teach and demystify the concept of meditation for users' long-term benefit. This paper presents the design phase of the project, starting by theoretically grounding the initial concept. We then discuss 15 co-design sessions which provided informal conceptual validation and led to several concrete design iterations aimed at balancing users' perceived sense of control. The presented approach to designing an interactive stress management system can be considered research through design, as it also resulted in a novel theoretical framework for the psychology of media immersion which has implications for a wide range of research areas.
