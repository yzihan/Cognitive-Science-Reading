## VR Nightmare

Dr. Patrick McNamara is at Boston University right across the river, and he just did a pilot study on using VR in combination with Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (changing the ending like you suggested) to treat nightmares. 

### Virtual reality-enabled treatment of nightmares

abstract:

>We pilot tested the efficacy of a virtual reality-based imagery rehearsal and rescripting treatment (ReScript) for nightmares. Nineteen community volunteers (Mage = 49 years) who varied in terms of their nightmare distress levels participated in a 4-week-long trial of ReScript therapy. Participants used VR manual controls in an Oculus headset to manipulate 3 scary or threatening images per session with 2 sessions per week. The object was to manipulate these images into less scary or threatening images so as to gain cognitive control over intrusive imagery and to lessen overall anxiety or nightmare distress or nightmare daytime effects. Images were taken from the International Affective Picture System database and varied along 3 affective dimensions (valence, arousal, and dominance) important for nightmare imagery. Results demonstrated a significant reduction (from baseline to trial end) in anxiety levels, nightmare distress, and nightmare effects (all effect sizes .63 or above), as well as a significant decrease in anxiety words and a significant increase in cognitive process words in rescripted narratives. Nightmare frequency was also significantly reduced though effect size was small. No significant side or adverse effects were reported by participants during the 4-week trial. Indeed, Depersonalization and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Checklist scores significantly declined and mood function tests improved over the 4-week trial. We conclude that ReScript may be a safe and effective short-term therapy for nightmare distress but should next be tested with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

background:

> Despite  the  significant  clinical  dysfunction  associated with  nightmare  distress,  nightmare  disorder  itself  remains  underdiagnosed  and understudied (Nadorff, Nadorff, & Germain, 2015), and there are no short-term, easy to use, and effective treatments for distress associated with nightmares or the anxiety associated with nightmares.

theory:

>Indeed, distress due to nightmares may be related to lack of mastery over intrusive imagery. 
>
>Consistent  with  the  idea  that  control  over  vivid  imagery  may  be  key  for amelioration of distress associated with nightmares is the work of Gackenbach and colleagues. 
>
>exposure to threatening or scary images (as in combat-centric video game play or more benignly in IRT) may allow individuals to develop defensive control over violent/frightening imagery that can then act as a form of nightmare protection (Flockhart & Gackenbach, 2017; Gackenbach et al., 2011, 2013).

approach:

>We developed a Virtual Reality app to treat anxiety and the distress associated with   nightmares   that   we   call   ReScript.   Consistent   with   Gackenbach   et   al.’s nightmare  protection  hypothesis,  ReScript  is  an  imagery  rescripting  therapy  that focuses  on  boosting  patients’  defensive  rehearsals  and  control  over  intrusive imagery processes.

>> For the pilot study, they designed moderately frightening virtual reality imagery—such as an underwater environment in which a great white shark seems to swim closer and closer to the virtual reality user—to elicit a manageable level of fear in participants.
>>
>> They enrolled 19 study participants who reported having frequent nightmares. Using joystick and gesture controls, participants were able to modify the threatening visuals to make them less scary.
>>
>> “We think that they learn these imagery-control skills and then over a couple of weeks, those skills get transferred from their conscious state into their dream state,” McNamara says.

one sentence summary:

>We propose that VR can be used to facilitate the learning of mental control over  intrusive  images  and  imagery  processing  and  thus  can  be  used  to  enhance imagery rescripting processes in IRT-related therapies to treat the distress associated with nightmares.
