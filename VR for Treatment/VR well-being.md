### Virtual Transcendent Dream: Empowering People through Embodied Flying in Virtual Reality

**Abstract**

Flying dreams have the potential to evoke a feeling of empowerment (or self-efficacy, confidence in our ability to succeed) and self-transcendent experience (STE), which have been shown to contribute to an individual’s overall well-being. However, these exceptional dreaming experiences remain difficult to induce at will. Inspired by the potential of Virtual Reality (VR) to support profound emotional experiences, we explored if a VR flying interface with more embodied self-motion cues could contribute to the benefits associated with flying dreams (i.e., STE and empowerment). Our results indicated that a flying interface with more self-motion cues indeed better supported STE and empowerment. We derived several design considerations: obscurity, extraordinary light and supportive setting. Our results contribute to the discourse around design guidelines for self-transcendence and empowerment in VR, which may further be applied to the improvement of mental well-being.

**Benefits**
1. Such transcendent flying dreams are one way of having a self-transcendent experience. Self-transcendent experience (STE) is characterized by a decrease in self-saliency (ego dissolution) and a resulting sense of global interconnectedness [74]. Some self-transcendent experiences can be associated with particular self-transcendent emotions such as compassion, awe, gratitude, appreciation, inspiration, admiration, elevation, love, and flow [74]. Self-transcendent emotions are typically positive experiences associated with benefits for an individual’s well-being [31, 47, 74] and pro-social intentions and behaviour [46, 53, 66].
2. Another quality observed in the experience of transcendent flying dreams is an increase in empowerment [48] –in transcendent dreams, the dreamers often possess an exceptional (or even magical) ability to attain their goals, and the powerful/competent feeling could be understood as a kinaesthetic aspect of movement efficacy (including flying or floating) [40].
