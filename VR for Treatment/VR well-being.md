### Virtual Transcendent Dream: Empowering People through Embodied Flying in Virtual Reality

**Abstract**

Flying dreams have the potential to evoke a feeling of empowerment (or self-efficacy, confidence in our ability to succeed) and self-transcendent experience (STE), which have been shown to contribute to an individual’s overall well-being. However, these exceptional dreaming experiences remain difficult to induce at will. Inspired by the potential of Virtual Reality (VR) to support profound emotional experiences, we explored if a VR flying interface with more embodied self-motion cues could contribute to the benefits associated with flying dreams (i.e., STE and empowerment). Our results indicated that a flying interface with more self-motion cues indeed better supported STE and empowerment. We derived several design considerations: obscurity, extraordinary light and supportive setting. Our results contribute to the discourse around design guidelines for self-transcendence and empowerment in VR, which may further be applied to the improvement of mental well-being.

**Benefits**
1. Self-transcendent experience (STE) is characterized by a decrease in self-saliency (ego dissolution) and a resulting sense of global interconnectedness [74]. Some self-transcendent experiences can be associated with particular self-transcendent emotions such as compassion, awe, gratitude, appreciation, inspiration, admiration, elevation, love, and flow [74]. Self-transcendent emotions are typically positive experiences associated with benefits for an individual’s well-being [31, 47, 74] and pro-social intentions and behaviour [46, 53, 66].
2. Increase in empowerment [48] – the dreamers often possess an exceptional (or even magical) ability to attain their goals, and the powerful/competent feeling could be understood as a kinaesthetic aspect of movement efficacy (including flying or floating) [40].

**Research questions**
1. Can a dream-inspired VR flying experience support feelings of dream flying, especially self-transcendence and empowerment? => Yes
2. Does a more embodied locomotion interface better support feelings of dream flying (including self-transcendence and empowerment) compared to a less embodied locomotion interface?
3. What are the key design elements that contributed to
participants’ (emotional) experience?

**Method**
1. quantitative component: the effect of self-motion
    1. self-transcendence: Modified Differential Emotions Scale (mDES), the Nondual Awareness Dimensional Assessment (NADA-S), the Awe Experience Scale(AWE-S-6), the Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS) Scale
    2. self-efficacy: the New General Self-Efficacy Scale (NGSE)
    3. overall experience: the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), a 16-item instrument including questions on self-motion, with additional immersion and presence questions
2. qualitative component: video recording, semi-structred interviews

    Hallucination
    Machine is a deep-dream neural network immersive 360 video system that simulates the visual hallucinatory experiences in a biologically plausible and ecologically valid way, as evidenced in two experiments. Isness [20] is a multi-person VR journey where participants experience the collective emergence, fluctuation, and dissipation of their bodies as energetic essence, comparable to a psychedelic experience.
