https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/admi.202202443

This paper is mostly about LED design, but they did an experiment at the end showing it can modulate sleep (and talk about developing some eyeglasses to use it for this purpose)

abstract

>Optoelectronics devices utilizing organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are emerging as new platforms for healthcare applications. In particular, wearable optoelectronics such as visual stimulus systems offer a distinctive advantage to intervene in and improve sleep disorders. In this study, two improvements are proposed for transparent OLEDs (TrOLEDs) that will be critical for visual applications. First, zinc sulfide with high surface energy and a high refractive index is explored as a seed and capping layer. An ultra-thin silver cathode of 8 nm is demonstrated to be feasible in TrOLEDs, and luminous transmittance of 91% is achieved. Second, in general, achieving the operational stability of TrOLEDs with high transmittance is challenging due to the vulnerability of thin electrodes. By introducing a doping process to the electron transport layer, a lifetime comparable to that of control OLEDs with thick cathodes (>90%) is secured. Last, a preclinical model using blue light is proposed to modulate sleep patterns. Melanopsin is stimulated at the highest level of sleep desire, reducing non-rapid eye movement sleep duration in mice by up to 14%. Based on these results, the proposed TrOLEDs are promising candidates for modulating sleep disorders such as insomnia and narcolepsy–cataplexy with the convenience of wearable form factors.



### Dream Marketing: A Method for Marketing Communication During Sleep and Dreams

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4353051

This paper is actually pretty bad scientifically, but relevant to the ethics of dream engineering!This work details a novel method for delivering marketing communications – i.e., advertisement and persuasive content - during dreams. The method allows marketing researchers and practitioners to penetrate the sleeping brain and access the dreamer’s thoughts with the goal of impacting subsequent awake behavior. This paper details the application and limitations of dream content induction. Additionally, the paper highlights specific implementation parameters (e.g., optimal stimulation locations and frequencies) necessary for successful inception of content. Finally, the work discusses the ethical challenges and risks of a future where people can be influenced while they are in an altered state of consciousness and their mental guards are down.

### Wearable Device-Delivered Intensive Sleep Retraining as an Adjunctive Treatment to Kickstart Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia

New paper on using wearable devices for insomnia treatment!

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36764786/

abstract

>Intensive Sleep Retraining is a behavioral treatment for sleep onset insomnia that produces substantial benefits in symptoms after a single treatment session. This technique involves falling asleep and waking up shortly afterward repeatedly: a process that is thought to retrain people to fall asleep quickly when attempting sleep. Although originally confined to the sleep laboratory, recent technological developments mean that this technique is feasible to self-administer at home. With multiple randomised controlled trials required to confirm its efficacy, Intensive Sleep Retraining may serve as an adjunctive treatment to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, improving short-term efficacy by kick-starting treatment gains.



### Capturing sleep–wake cycles by using day-to-day smartphone touchscreen interactions

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0147-4

abstract

> Body movements drop with sleep, and this behavioural signature is widely exploited to infer sleep duration. However, a reduction in body movements may also occur in periods of intense cognitive activity, and the ubiquitous use of smartphones may capture these wakeful periods otherwise hidden in the standard measures of sleep. Here, we continuously captured the gross body movements using standard wrist-worn accelerometers to quantify sleep (actigraphy) and logged the timing of the day-to-day touchscreen events (‘tappigraphy’). Using these measures, we addressed how the gross body movements overlap with the cognitively engaging digital behaviour (from *n* = 79 individuals, accumulating ~1400 nights). We find that smartphone use was distributed across a broad spectrum of physical activity levels, but consistently peaked at rest. We estimated the putative sleep onset and wake-up times from the actigraphy data to find that these times were well correlated to the estimates from tappigraphy (R2 = 0.9 for sleep-onset time and wake-up time). However, actigraphy overestimated sleep as virtually all of the users used their phones during the putative sleep period. Interestingly, the probability of touches remained greater than zero for ~2 h after the putative sleep onset, and ~2 h before the putative wake-up time. Our findings suggest that touchscreen interactions are widely integrated into modern sleeping habits—surrounding both sleep onset and waking-up periods—yielding a new approach to measuring sleep. Smartphone interactions can be leveraged to update the behavioural signatures of sleep with these peculiarities of modern digital behaviour.



### Nightly sleep duration predicts grade point average in the first year of college

Significance

> Total nightly sleep is a potentially important and underappreciated behavior supporting academic achievement. First-year college students from three independent universities provided sleep actigraphy for a month early in the academic term, across five separate samples. Lower average nightly sleep early in the academic term predicted lower end-of-term GPA, an effect that held even when controlling for factors known to predict end-of-term GPA, including previous-term GPA, daytime sleep, and overall academic load. Every hour of lost total average nightly sleep was associated with a 0.07 reduction in end-of-term GPA. These findings help establish nightly sleep duration as an important factor for academic success in the formative first year of college.

Abstract

> Academic achievement in the first year of college is critical for setting students on a pathway toward long-term academic and life success, yet little is known about the factors that shape early college academic achievement. Given the important role sleep plays in learning and memory, here we extend this work to evaluate whether nightly sleep duration predicts change in end-of-semester grade point average (GPA). First-year college students from three independent universities provided sleep actigraphy for a month early in their winter/spring academic term across five studies. Findings showed that greater early-term total nightly sleep duration predicted higher end-of-term GPA, an effect that persisted even after controlling for previous-term GPA and daytime sleep. Specifically, every additional hour of average nightly sleep duration early in the semester was associated with an 0.07 increase in end-of-term GPA. Sensitivity analyses using sleep thresholds also indicated that sleeping less than 6 h each night was a period where sleep shifted from helpful to harmful for end-of-term GPA, relative to previous-term GPA. Notably, predictive relationships with GPA were specific to total nightly sleep duration, and not other markers of sleep, such as the midpoint of a student’s nightly sleep window or bedtime timing variability. These findings across five studies establish nightly sleep duration as an important factor in academic success and highlight the potential value of testing early academic term total sleep time interventions during the formative first year of college.



### Self-reported and measured sleep duration: How similar are they

Background: 

> Recent epidemiologic studies have found that self-reported duration of sleep is associated with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and mortality. The extent to which self reports of sleep duration are similar to objective measures and whether individual characteristics influence the degree of similarity are not known.

Methods: 

> Eligible participants at the Chicago site of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study were invited to participate in a 2003–2005 ancillary sleep study; 82% (n = 669) agreed. Sleep measurements collected in 2 waves included 3 days each of wrist actigraphy, a sleep log, and questions about usual sleep duration. We estimate the average difference and correlation between subjectively and objectively measured sleep by using errors-in-variables regression models.

Results: 

> Average measured sleep was 6 hours, whereas the average from subjective reports was 6.8 hours. Subjective reports increased on average by 34 minutes for each additional hour of measured sleep. Overall, the correlation between reported and measured sleep duration was 0.47. Our model suggests that persons sleeping 5 hours over-reported their sleep duration by 1.2 hours, and those sleeping 7 hours over-reported by 0.4 hours. The correlations and average differences between self-reports and measured sleep varied by health, sociodemographic, and sleep characteristics.

Conclusion: 

> In a population-based sample of middle-aged adults, subjective reports of habitual sleep are moderately correlated with actigraph-measured sleep, but are biased by systematic over-reporting. The true associations between sleep duration and health may differ from previously reported associations between self-reported sleep and health.

### Topographical EEG Mapping in a Case of Recurrent Sleep Terrors
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:DREM.0000005897.62698.1b#:~:text=EEG%20features%20distinguishing%20nightmare%20from,power%20and%20right%20temporal%20asymmetries

Abstract:

> Sleep terrors are characterized by marked CNS arousal and typically occur during stage 3-4 sleep within the first NREM cycle. Studies of the EEG during sleep terrors suggest that delta power and synchrony in the EEG may be important physiological markers of sleep terror presence and intensity. An EEG mapping study was undertaken with a single participant who experienced three sleep terror episodes in the laboratory. A one-minute section of EEG was sampled immediately prior to the onset of each of the three sleep terrors. Similar EEG sections were taken from 10 healthy sex- and age-matched controls. The sleep tenors and control (normative) data were then compared topographically with z-scores (z-mapping). The z-maps indicated that all three sleep terrors contained more total and delta power in central and frontal areas than the control EEG sections. Moreover, relative delta power in these areas for the three sleep terrors was proportional to the subjective intensity of the episode. Although this pre-arousal EEG pattern may be related to ongoing slow-wave sleep mentation that may sometimes trigger sleep terror episodes, its functional significance remains an open question. The results demonstrate the utility of EEG mapping for the quantification of brain activation during sleep terror attacks and suggest that discrete activity profiles are identifiable for different types of dreaming-related arousal.

### REM Sleep Theta Changes in Frequent Nightmare Recallers
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5806577/

Study Objectives:

> To replicate and expand upon past research by evaluating sleep and wake electroencephalographic spectral activity in samples of frequent nightmare (NM) recallers and healthy controls.

Methods:

> Computation of spectral activity for sleep (non-REM and REM) and wake electroencephalogram recordings from 18 frequent NM recallers and 15 control participants.

Results:

> There was higher “slow-theta” (2–5 Hz) for NM recallers than for controls during wake, non-REM sleep and REM sleep. Differences were clearest for frontal and central derivations and for REM sleep cycles 2-4. There was also higher beta activity during NREM sleep for NM recallers. Findings partially replicate past research by demonstrating higher relative “slow-theta” (3-4Hz) for NM recallers than for controls.

Conclusions:

> Findings are consistent with a neurocognitive model of nightmares that stipulates cross-state anomalies in emotion processing in NM-prone individuals.
