> While asleep, people heard sounds that had earlier been associated with objects at specific spatial locations. Upon waking, they recalled these locations more accurately than other locations for which no reminder cues were provided. Consolidation thus operates during sleep with high specificity and is subject to systematic influences through simple auditory stimulation.

abstract

> Targeted memory reactivation is a fairly simple technique that has the potential to influence the course of memory formation through application of cues during sleep. Studies have shown that cueing memory during sleep can lead to either an enhanced or decreased representation of the information encoded in the targeted networks, depending on experimental variations. The effects have been associated with sleep parameters and accompanied by activation of memory related brain areas. The findings suggest a causal role of neuronal replay in memory consolidation and provide evidence for the active system consolidation hypothesis. However, the observed inconsistencies across studies suggest that further research is warranted regarding the underlying neural mechanisms and optimal conditions for the application of targeted memory reactivation. The goal of the present review is to integrate the currently available experimental data and to provide an overview of this technique's limitations and pitfalls, as well as its potential applications in everyday use and clinical treatment. Exploring the open questions herein identified should lead to insight into safer and more effective ways of adjusting memory representations to better suit individual needs.

### Tap To Remember

abstract

> Tap To Remember is a wearable memory prosthesis.  We are testing whether laboratory techniques for enhancing memory--such as targeted memory reactivation, theta wave entrainment, and spaced repetition--can be unintrusively integrated into a smartwatch and used to improve memory. Our goal is to facilitate learning in healthy people, and improve memory function and quality of life in people suffering from memory disorders.

> Currently, we are beginning a study to test whether Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) with smartwatches can be used to improve memory for everyday events. In this study, participants watch a movie while wearing a smartwatch that periodically vibrates in a specific pattern.  When participants go to bed,  an algorithm in the smartwatches detects deep sleep and replays the same sequence of vibrations, inducing reactivation of the memory in sleep. This technique has previously been shown to improve memory in laboratory tests; our experiment aims to show that the technique can be used outside the lab to enhance memory for everyday events.



### Improving Memory via Automated Targeted Memory Reactivation during Sleep

abstract:
A widely accepted view in memory research is that previously acquired information can be reactivated during sleep, leading to persistent memory storage. Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) was developed as a technique whereby specific memories can be reactivated during sleep using a sensory stimulus linked to prior learning. As a research tool, TMR can improve memory, raising the possibility that it may be useful for cognitive enhancement and clinical therapy. A major challenge for the expanded use of TMR is that a skilled operator must manually control stimulation, which is impractical in many settings. To address this limitation, we developed the SleepStim system for automated TMR in the home. SleepStim includes a smartwatch to collect movement and heart-rate data, plus a smartphone to emit auditory cues. A machine-learning model identifies periods of deep sleep and triggers TMR sounds within these periods. We tested whether this system could replicate the spatial-memory benefit of in-laboratory TMR. Participants learned locations of objects on a grid, and then half of the object locations were reactivated during sleep over 3â€‰nights. Recall was tested each morning. In an experiment with 61 participants, the TMR effect was not significant but varied systematically with stimulus intensity; low-intensity but not high-intensity stimuli produced memory benefits. In a second experiment with 24 participants, we limited stimulus intensity and found that TMR reliably improved spatial memory, consistent with effects observed in laboratory studies. We conclude that SleepStim can effectively accomplish automated TMR, and that avoiding sleep disruption is critical for TMR benefits.

discuss:  The ability to deliver closed-loop interventions in sleep using SleepStim may also be useful for applications beyond TMR, such as influencing dream content (Konkoly et al., 2021) or non-phase-locked entrainment to increase slow wave and spindle activity (Antony & Paller, 2016; Simor et al., 2018).

### Dream drill: learning application

**Abstract**

> Some evidence indicates that sleep supports memory consolidation. Items studied before sleeps are memorized more efficiently than those not followed by sleep. Consequently, we propose a learning management system based on these findings. The system includes an alarm clock, whose alarm is set only if a user answers some questions. The user also has to answer the same questions once the clock has awakened him or her in the morning. We implemented a prototype and conducted a user study with five participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the system.
