> While asleep, people heard sounds that had earlier been associated with objects at specific spatial locations. Upon waking, they recalled these locations more accurately than other locations for which no reminder cues were provided. Consolidation thus operates during sleep with high specificity and is subject to systematic influences through simple auditory stimulation.

### State of the art on targeted memory reactivation: Sleep your way to enhanced cognition

abstract

> Targeted memory reactivation is a fairly simple technique that has the potential to influence the course of memory formation through application of cues during sleep. Studies have shown that cueing memory during sleep can lead to either an enhanced or decreased representation of the information encoded in the targeted networks, depending on experimental variations. The effects have been associated with sleep parameters and accompanied by activation of memory related brain areas. The findings suggest a causal role of neuronal replay in memory consolidation and provide evidence for the active system consolidation hypothesis. However, the observed inconsistencies across studies suggest that further research is warranted regarding the underlying neural mechanisms and optimal conditions for the application of targeted memory reactivation. The goal of the present review is to integrate the currently available experimental data and to provide an overview of this technique's limitations and pitfalls, as well as its potential applications in everyday use and clinical treatment. Exploring the open questions herein identified should lead to insight into safer and more effective ways of adjusting memory representations to better suit individual needs.

### Tap To Remember

> Tap To Remember is a wearable memory prosthesis.  We are testing whether laboratory techniques for enhancing memory--such as targeted memory reactivation, theta wave entrainment, and spaced repetition--can be unintrusively integrated into a smartwatch and used to improve memory. Our goal is to facilitate learning in healthy people, and improve memory function and quality of life in people suffering from memory disorders.

> Currently, we are beginning a study to test whether Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) with smartwatches can be used to improve memory for everyday events. In this study, participants watch a movie while wearing a smartwatch that periodically vibrates in a specific pattern.  When participants go to bed,  an algorithm in the smartwatches detects deep sleep and replays the same sequence of vibrations, inducing reactivation of the memory in sleep. This technique has previously been shown to improve memory in laboratory tests; our experiment aims to show that the technique can be used outside the lab to enhance memory for everyday events.
