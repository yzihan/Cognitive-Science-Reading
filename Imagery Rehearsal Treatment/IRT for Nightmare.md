## Imagery Rehearsal Treatment for Nightmare

### Nightmare Rescripting: Using Imagery Techniques to Treat Sleep Disturbances in Post-traumatic Stress Disorder

DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.866144

Abstract 
> Besides affecting 8% of the general population, nightmares are one of the most frequent symptoms of traumatized individuals. This can be a significant factor in the treatment of post-traumatic disorders; indeed, several studies demonstrated its strong predictive and prognostic value. Sleep disorders, nightmares in particular, could be very distressing for individuals and need targeted interventions, especially if they are associated with a PTSD diagnosis. To date, the best technique for the treatment of traumatic sleep disturbances seems to be Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT), an empirically supported method. Through a review of the literature on this matter, this article aims to outline the incidence and consequences of nightmares in PTSD, illustrate how IRT could prove useful in their treatment, and investigate its clinical applications.

Takeaway
> This article goes over a thorough explanation of the IRT procedure. It also introduces several clinical applications of IRT on war veterans, sexual abuse victims, and children and adolescents.

### Brief Report: Treatment of Combat-Related Nightmares Using Imagery Rehearsal: A Pilot Study

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1011133422340

Abstract
> Posttraumatic nightmares are a hallmark of PTSD and distinct from general nightmares as they are often repetitive and faithful representations of the traumatic event. This paper presents data from a pilot study that examined the use of Imagery Rehearsal in treating combat-related nightmares of 12 Vietnam veterans with PTSD. Three treatment groups, comprising 4 veterans in each, completed standardised treatment across 6 sessions. Treatment effects were investigated using nightmare diaries and established instruments, including the IES-R, BDI, BAI, and SCL-90-R. The data demonstrate significant reductions in nightmares targeted, and improvements in PTSD and comorbid symptomatology. The paper recommends that, on the basis of the promising preliminary data, a randomised control trial be established to assess imagery ability and attidude toward nightmares.

### Combat-related PTSD nightmares and imagery rehearsal: nightmare characteristics and relation to treatment outcome

DOI: 10.1002/jts.21748

Abstract
> The characteristics of nightmares of 48 male U.S. Vietnam war veterans with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as revised dream scripts developed in the course of Imagery Rehearsal therapy, were examined in relation to pretreatment symptomatology and treatment outcome. Features, content, and themes of nightmares and rescripted dreams were coded by 2 independent raters. Nightmares were replete with scenes of death and violence and were predominantly replays of actual combat events in which the veteran was under attack and feared for his life. Although addressing or resolving the nightmare theme with rescripting was associated with a reduction in sleep disturbance, references to violence in the rescripted dream were related to poorer treatment outcome in nightmare frequency; B = 5.69 (SE = 1.14). The experience of olfactory sensations in nightmares, a possible index of nightmare intensity, was also related to poorer treatment response; B = 2.95 (SE = 1.06). Imagery rehearsal for individuals with severe, chronic PTSD and fairly replicative nightmares may be most effective when the rescripted dream incorporates a resolution of the nightmare theme and excludes violent details.

### Nightmare Themes: An Online Study of Most Recent Nightmares and Childhood Nightmares

DOI: 10.5664/jcsm.7002

Brief Summary
> Current Knowledge/Study Rationale: The definition of a nightmare given in diagnostic manuals (ICSD-3, DSM-5, ICD-10) focuses on threats to
survival, security, or physical integrity. However, empirical studies on nightmare content in larger samples are scarce.
> Study Impact: The findings of the current study clearly indicate that current definitions of nightmare content are too narrow (ie, death/injury of close
persons is also an important nightmare theme). Infrequent themes such as being the aggressor and suicide are of special interest because they might
be related to waking-life psychopathology.

Takeaway
> Introduced an approach to sutdy nightmare themes and compiled a list of common nightmare themes. 

### Thematic and Content Analysis of Idiopathic Nightmares and Bad Dreams

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5665/sleep.3426

Abstract
> Five hundred seventy-two participants kept a written record of all of their remembered dreams in a log for 2 to 5 consecutive weeks. A total of 9,796 dream reports were collected and the content of 253 nightmares and 431 bad dreams reported by 331 participants was investigated. Physical aggression was the most frequently reported theme in nightmares, whereas interpersonal conflicts predominated in bad dreams. Nightmares were rated by participants as being substantially more emotionally intense than were bad dreams. Thirtyfive percent of nightmares and 55% of bad dreams contained primary emotions other than fear. When compared to bad dreams, nightmares were more bizarre and contained substantially more aggressions, failures, and unfortunate endings.
