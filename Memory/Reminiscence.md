### PicMemory: Enriching Intergenerational Family Interaction and Memory Collection

doi: https://doi.org/10.1145/2851581.2890233

**Abstract**
The goals of this study are to create opportunities for enriching the family interaction and collaboratively collecting family stories among family members. We present PicMemory, an interactive mobile application for bridging the gaps of technology familiar between the older and the younger generations in the intergenerational family. We purpose three functions: (1) Multi-model story collection; (2) Collaborative memory organization; and (3) Enriched family interaction, to facilitate the communication and memory collection within the family. In this demonstration, we extend the concepts of enriching conference experience by collecting participants' feedback and organizing the memories of the conference. We are looking forward to seeing the PicMemory can be used to interact with all participants, and willing to hearing about any interesting user experiences. Meanwhile, we will collect user feedback to inform our future directions of the PicMemory.

### Picgo: designing reminiscence and storytelling for the elderly with photo annotation

doi: https://doi.org/10.1145/2598784.2602769

**Abstract**
The goal of this study is to retrieve important life fragments using a visual photo annotation interface and the familial stories behind the photos. We present the design of Picgo, a game-based reminiscence service that enables elders to capture memories, annotate photos, and iteratively reinforce the annotation of photos in a storytelling process. There are two main functions of the process of Picgo: (1) Capturing and Annotation; (2) Browsing and Reinforcement. Finally, by analyzing the relevance between the tags and calculating the impressive level of the photos, Picgo is able to provide meaningful reminiscent materials to caregivers and occupational therapists in reminiscence therapy that can trigger elders' memory successfully.

### Smart Conversational Agents for Reminiscence

**Abstract**
In this paper we describe the requirements and early system design for a smart conversational agent that can assist older adults in the reminiscence process. The practice of reminiscence has well documented benefits for the mental, social and emotional well-being of older adults. However, the technology support, valuable in many different ways, is still limited in terms of need of co-located human presence, data collection capabilities, and ability to support sustained engagement, thus missing key opportunities to improve care practices, facilitate social interactions, and bring the reminiscence practice closer to those with less opportunities to engage in co-located sessions with a (trained) companion. We discuss conversational agents and cognitive services as the platform for building the next generation of reminiscence applications, and introduce the concept application of a smart reminiscence agent.

### Forming a story: The health benefits of narrative

doi: https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(199910)55:10<1243::AID-JCLP6>3.0.CO;2-N

**Abstract**
Writing about important personal experiences in an emotional way for as little as 15 minutes over the course of three days brings about improvements in mental and physical health. This finding has been replicated across age, gender, culture, social class, and personality type. Using a text-analysis computer program, it was discovered that those who benefit maximally from writing tend to use a high number of positive-emotion words, a moderate amount of negative-emotion words, and increase their use of cognitive words over the days of writing. These findings suggest that the formation of a narrative is critical and is an indicator of good mental and physical health. Ongoing studies suggest that writing serves the function of organizing complex emotional experiences. Implications for these findings for psychotherapy are briefly discussed.

### Bridging practices, theories, and technologies to support reminiscence

>Time: 2011 CHI

**Abstract**
Reminiscence is a valuable human activity.
1) understanding people's current practices around reminiscing, 2) using empirical studies and theories of memory to inform technology designs, 3) evaluating existing technologies for reminiscence, 4) exploring ways that technology might support new reminiscing practices, and 5) supporting social aspects of reminiscence. 

### Past places and social reminiscence

>Time: 2015 UbiComp

**Abstract**
Existing researches on reminiscence assume that past visual references are readily available as memory stimuli, however in reality such material may be difficult to obtain for certain communities. My thesis proposes that virtual representation of past places can be created with limited historic reference materials by utilizing maps, aerial survey records, non-photorealistic rendering techniques, literati painting artistic expression, and 3D computer graphics. This research aims to explore the effectiveness of such visuals as contents of ubiquitous computing to facilitate intergenerational social reminiscence.

**Insights**
1. methods: maps, aerial survey records, non-photorealistic rendering techniques, literati painting artistic expression, and 3D computer graphics
2. goal: explore the effectiveness of such visuals as contents of ubiquitous computing to facilitate intergenerational social reminiscence

### Designing for Reminiscence with People with Dementia

>Time 2019 CHI

**Abstract**
We investigate how technology can be used to support people with dementia to engage in Reminiscence Therapy. We used a participatory design approach carried out over three stages: scope, design and evaluation, involving five participants with dementia. We also engaged professionals and caregivers through a survey. We provide initial recommendations for engaging participants with dementia on how they wish to reminisce and what technology may support this.

### Towards A Design For Life: Redesigning For Reminiscence With Looked After Children

>Time 2020 CHI

**Abstract**
For 'looked-after' and adopted children, physical objects are often the only remaining link to their pasts; a portal to stories of former families, homes, and events. The act of reminiscence, known as 'life story work', can help children to process their pasts and overcome trauma. This paper describes the user-centred redesign of Trove, a digital and physical memory box for storing and curating stories about precious objects. We describe our redesign process, synthesising the insights from previous Trove evaluations with looked-after and adopted children, and three re-design workshops with 4 looked-after children at a therapeutic residential school. Our findings advocate for prioritisation of Trove's digital and physical security, the sustainability of its companionship, and the provision of multimedia storytelling to encourage the construction of identity narratives. Inspired by this, we present and discuss the redeveloped Trove, before analysing our participatory design approach with these complex and under-represented groups.

### Framing design of reminiscence aids with transactive memory theory

>Time 2013 CHI

**Abstract**
This work aims at designing reminiscence aids that help people remember meaningful events. With an epistemological stance of research through design, the framing of the Oblivescence Board was informed by theories in social psychology and psycholinguistics. We brought a neglected drawback (i.e. forgetting) of a transactive memory system to the center of a reminiscence dialogue, where an embodied negotiation of common grounds was constructed out of a visualization metaphor. The qualitative results from a field experimental were gathered to reframe our future direction. Several design implications are also addressed to identify the opportunities for the future work. We argue that a reminiscence aid should (1) evoke curiosity and empathy for shifting responsibility, (2) provide embodied metaphor to communicate personal significance and system's expression, and (3) interweave reminiscence activities into daily practice.

### Time perspectives in technology-mediated reminiscing: effects of basic design decisions on subjective well-being

>Time 2020 Psychology

**Abstract**
Photographs, memorabilia, and digital "reminiscence technologies" highlight a certain part of our past and propose a way to interact with it. This central role of technology in shaping reminiscence has motivated researchers and designers to develop tools for pleasurable interactions with the past. Detailed accounts of specific reminiscence technologies exist, but a systematic comparison of different ways to reminisce and their effect on subjective well-being is still missing. Moreover, while it is widely acknowledged that personal memories are very personal, individual differences in positive or negative "time perspectives" on one's past have not been researched in HCI yet. We present two comparative online studies (N = 152 and 125) about different modes of reminiscing and how they affect people with different time perspectives. Participants immersed in fictional reminiscing scenarios that we varied using the experimental vignette methodology. Overall, technology-mediation had a positive effect, especially for people with an unbalanced time perspective. Moreover, we found evidence indicating that the "rosy view" effect found in previous studies may be restricted to people with a balanced time perspective only. We close with specific design implications for different time perspectives and a call for more convergent research on remembering technologies.

**Results**
1. Technology-mediated reminiscing leads to more positive affect than unmediated reminiscing
2. Technologies supporting **spontaneous, externally triggered reminiscing** lead to more positive affect than those requiring intentional interaction
3. two different types of past experiences, The happiest memory of one’s “entire life” (emotionally intense and personally relevant) and of one’s “past week” (less intense and less relevant). => Reminiscing about more intense positive experiences leads to more positive affect than reminiscing about less intense positive experiences; Psychological need fulfillment is higher for more **intense positive experiences** than for less intense positive experiences
4. time perspective profiles => Participants with a more balanced past time perspective experience more positive affect during reminiscing about positive experiences than participants with a less balanced past time perspective
5. expected effects of reminiscing on immediate positive and negative affect, but less on general life satisfaction


**Insights**
1. Time perspectives
Time perspective theory is the idea that our perceptions of time influence our emotions, perceptions, and actions. Most time perspective models break down our time perspectives into chronological categories such as: Past. Present.
2. positive effects of reminiscence
3. spontaneous, externally triggered reminiscing
4. intense positive experiences

### Pensieve: supporting everyday reminiscence

>Time CHI 10

**Abstract**
Pensieve [9], a system that helps people 
remember to reminisce by sending them occasional emails 
containing “memory triggers”.
Pensieve has two main functions: to remind people to 
reminisce, and to help people write in the course of 
reminiscing. People choose how often to be reminded to 
reminisce and can also link Pensieve to accounts on 
selected social media sites, including Flickr, twitter, Picasa, 
Blogger, and Last.fm. The Pensieve server uses these 
preferences to create memory triggers, emails that contain 
specific pieces of content either taken from a linked social 
media site or a set of non-personalized text prompts 
somewhat like those used in group reminiscence therapy2

**Insights**
1. benefit: This is natural, given the focus in psychology on reminiscence as a potential “treatment” aimed at the elderly, to help people come to accept the past, to hopefully mitigate the effects of dementia, and frankly, just to give care home staff a structured activity to share with residents. Reminiscence strengthens self-esteem and provides pleasure and enjoyment. Not all reminiscence is positive—people also 
reminisce to maintain grudges and to escape the present—but on balance it is a positive activity.
2. People report that reminiscence is usually spontaneous, externally triggered, and often not consciously attended to
3. We tell stories of our past experiences to make friends, while a newspaper photo depicting one’s hometown sometimes brings back a flood of childhood memories.
4. related products: SharePic is a gesture 
based, multi-touch, multi-user collaborative tabletop device 
for photo sharing aimed at the elderly. CaraClock [32] 
supports sharing collective family memories through 
metadata-enhanced photo collections, allowing interesting 
views such as “everyone in the family at age 20” and 
supporting intelligent selection of photos to show based on 
the relationships in the group. The Personal Digital 
Historian Project [29] aims to help users to share and reflect 
on individual or collective experiences with others, while 
the Living Memory Box [30] helps families preserve their 
memories in a variety of media forms.

### Enriching Social Sharing for the Dementia Community: Insights from In-person and Online Social Programs

>Time 2023 ACM Journals: Tranactions on Accessible computing 

**Abstract**
The dementia community faces major challenges in social engagements, which have been further complicated by the prolonged physical distancing measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Designing digital tools for in-person social sharing in family and care facility settings has been well explored, but comparatively little HCI work has focused on the design of community-based social technologies for virtual settings. We present our virtual fieldwork on remote social activities explored by one dementia community in response to the impacts of the pandemic. Building upon our previously published on-site fieldwork in this community, we expand on our initial publication by follow-up interviewing caregivers and facilitators and reflecting on a virtual social program. Through thematic analysis and contrasting in-person and online formats of the program, we deepened the understanding of virtual social engagements of the dementia community, examining their efforts to leverage physical objects and environments, enhance open and flexible experiences, and expand collaborative space. We propose to open new design opportunities through holistic approaches, including reimagining community social spaces, rethinking agency in people with dementia and caregivers, and diversifying HCI support across communities and stakeholders.

### “It took me back 25 years in one bound”: self-generated flavor-based cues for self-defining memories in later life

>Time 2022 Human-Computer Interaction Journal on Taylor&Francis Online

**Abstract**
Our work explores the feasibility of 3D printed flavor-based cues for the recall of self-defining memories in old age. In a two-month project with 12 older adults, we employed a 3 stage mixed methodology through which we elicited 72 self-defining memories, codesigned bespoke flavor-based cues for each one, and explored in participants’ homes the impact of these 3D printed flavor-based cues on the recall of their self-defining memories. This paper focuses on the following research questions:
1. What is the role of food in self-defining memories and how can it be leveraged for cuing them?
2. How can we support older adults to co-design personalized 3D printed flavor-based cues?
3. What is the value of such personalized 3D printed flavors for prompting older adults’ self-defining memories, and more broadly for multisensory food interaction and memory technologies?
The main contributions of this paper include (i) sense data and perceptual data as concepts reflecting flexible resource for design of memory technologies in the form of perceived sensory qualities of stimuli impacting each of our senses, and as subjective experience of perceived sensory integration, respectively, the latter illustrated through flavor-based memory cues whose experiential qualities we have also unpacked; (ii) tailored approach, engaging bodily senses, for designing 3D printed personalized flavors as memory cues that capture and integrate unimodal sensory fragments; (iii) implications for designing novel interactions leveraging flavor as resource for design integrating sense data, in particular for novel recreational and therapeutic multisensory reminiscing, and for body-centric multisensory design methods.

### An Underdeveloped Metaphor: The Mismatched Designs and Motivations of Digital Picture Interactions

>Time 2022 ACM Journals: Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction

**Abstract**
Picture interactions are key to daily and long-term social connections between families and communities, especially through reminiscence. Across the nearly 200-year history of domestic photography, this social reminiscence has been accomplished largely through photo albums. However, in the now common digital setting, albums are pushed aside for the endless film roll metaphor. In this paper we explore this metaphor through the 20-year history of proposed digital picture interactions from Human-Computer Interaction research, and compare this to ongoing interactions with modern picture tools. Through these, we reveal that this prominent design metaphor does not create space for social reminiscence, but does fit the novel use of immediate sharing seen across social networking. Further, the endless and ever-growing nature of digital film rolls are not meaningfully browsable for either intended use. We close by reconnecting to the past works that explore the broad potential of digital pictures.

### Replicating autobiographical memory research using social media: a case study

>Time 2021 Journal: Memory

**Abstract**
The durability of memories for personally experienced events and the effectiveness of naturalistically generated cues of those events were investigated via a case study using Timehop to re-present information from Facebook, Twitter, and the iPhone photograph archive from the past six years to generate autobiographical memories. Replicating prior longitudinal self-studies of remembering, recency predicted successful recall of specific events. Prior research showing images to be more evocative of autobiographical remembering than text was also replicated here. Results also supported claims that direct retrieval is a common mode of remembering. Somewhat surprisingly, retrieval of autobiographical memories had little influence on ongoing affect, cognition, and behaviour. This is suggested as "proof of concept" that social media data allows for modern replication of diary-type studies and expansion beyond typical participant pools. The interrelated functions of social media for remembering and of autobiographical remembering to social media can also be explored with this method.

### Social Reminiscence in Older Adults’ Everyday Conversations: Automated Detection Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning

>Time 2020 National Library of Medicine

**Conclusion**
This study provides evidence of the applicability of NLP and machine learning pipelines for the automated detection of reminiscence in older adults’ everyday conversations in German. The methods and findings of this study could be relevant for designing unobtrusive computer systems for the real-time detection of social reminiscence in the everyday life of older adults and classifying their functions. With further improvements, these systems could be deployed in health interventions aimed at improving older adults’ well-being by promoting self-reflection and suggesting coping strategies to be used in the case of dysfunctional reminiscence cases, which can undermine physical and mental health.
