Memory types :

Episodic memory and semantic memory are two types of declarative memory, and one might be impacted without the other. Episodic memory refers to the capacity for recollecting happenings from the past, for remembering  events  that  occurred  in  particular  spatial  and  temporal contexts. Semantic memory refers to the capacity for recollecting facts an general knowledge about the world. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1098-1063(1998)8:3%3C205::AID-HIPO3%3E3.0.CO;2-I

Memory is consolidated during REM sleep (the period of sleep during which we are the most likely to dream) :

REM sleep seems to enable us to form new connections by integrating new experiences into our elaborate and immense network of personal experience. Several studies have looked at how associative processing in REM sleep might lead to insight or creativity. For instance, when awakening from REM sleep, subjects are better at finding solutions to anagrams, a task that requires creative associative processing in order to rearrange a jumble of letters to produce a new word.

Sleep preferentially consolidates memories that are more important for the future, such as emotional experiences.
With this in mind, a recent study attempted to assess the associative power of REM sleep on emotional vs. neutral stimuli. The results suggest that positive emotional experiences may enhance the spreading and forming of new connections during REM.

A widely accepted view in memory research is that previously acquired information can be reactivated during sleep, leading to persistent memory storage.

Large, “uncompressed” episodic memory is converted into long term semantic (compressed) memory

Sleep is known to support memory consolidation. At the beginning of this process is sleep’s ability to preserve episodic experiences preferentially encoded in hippocampal network. Repeated neuronal reactivation of these representations during slow-wave sleep transforms episodic representations into long-term memories (semantic), redistributes them toward extrahippocampal networks, and qualitatively changes them to decontextualized schema-like representations (compressed, textual-like semantic information) https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/se367/14/Readings/papers/inostroza-born-13_sleep-for-transforming-episodic-memory.pdf

 

Procedural memory, perceptual representation system, semantic and episodic memory benefit either from NREM or REM sleep, or from both: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2005.00450.x

how often are dreams first person perspective vss third?
It depends on sleep stage that they are awakening from, and the age of participants. Young children, for instance, have very few 1st person dreams. But it's rare in adults to get a purely 3rd person perspective dream. The 1st and 2nd paper below are on this.

I’ve found this writer (Danielle Carr) very challenging and very interesting. Here are two articles which made me rethink mental health and neuralink:
