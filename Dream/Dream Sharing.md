### Dream Sharing as Social Interaction

doi: https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009452822669

**Abstract**
> A survey was administered to 241 individuals whose questionnaire responses were analyzed to determine if they told their dreams to others, to whom they told their dreams, for what purpose, and in what social contexts dreams were shared. Respondents were also asked whether there were types of dreams they would not tell and individuals with whom they would not share dreams. This exploratory study suggests that dream sharing is a part of everyday social interaction, with the primary purpose of entertainment. There are gender differences with regard to dream sharing, and this sharing involves the utilization of social practices whereby individuals may protect themselves and others through deciding whether or not to share a dream. The study describes dream sharing as a social act that is negotiated based on the social rules regarding what topics friends and other intimates share in public or private.

### Frequency of dream sharing: The effects of gender and personality 

doi: https://doi.org/10.5406/amerjpsyc.123.1.0093

**Abstract**
> Although dreaming is a private experience, dream sharing is a common experience for most people. Dreams are disclosed to romantic partners, friends, and relatives, and the sharing is often associated with enhancement of relational intimacy and stress relief (e.g., in the case of nightmares). Research has focused on factors that might affect dream sharing such as dream recall frequency, gender, and emotional intensity of the dream. The present findings indicate that about 14.5% of the dreams were shared and that dream recall frequency, nightmare frequency, attitude toward dreams, gender, extroversion, and thin boundaries are associated independently with the frequency of dream sharing. Longitudinal studies are needed to differentiate between state factors and trait factors and to validate the self-reported positive effects of dream sharing on intimacy in romantic relationships and friendships.

### Personal Dream Informatics: A Self-Information Systems Model of Dream Engagement

doi: https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517669

**Abstract**
> We present the research area of personal dream informatics: studying the self-information systems that support dream engagement and communication between the dreaming self and the wakeful self. Through a survey study of 281 individuals primarily recruited from an online community dedicated to dreaming, we develop a dream-information systems view of dreaming and dream tracking as a type of self-information system. While dream-information systems are characterized by diverse tracking processes, motivations, and outcomes, they are universally constrained by the ephemeral dreamset—the short period of time between waking up and rapid memory loss of dream experiences. By developing a system dynamics model of dreaming we highlight feedback loops that serve as high leverage points for technology designers, and suggest a variety of design considerations for crafting technology that best supports dream recall, dream tracking, and dreamwork for nightmare relief and personal development.
**Insights**
> Dream sharing, as a social practice, is better documented. Dream sharing is generally undertaken due to reported feelings (real or 1This can be considered a type of reactivity efect, where the act of measuring changes the thing being measured, and often in a desired direction [25, 61]. aspirational) of trust and closeness to those with whom the dreams are shared [43], and may be triggered by dreams with increased levels of emotional intensity [15]. Dream sharing can increase levels of empathy towards the sharing dreamer [5], perhaps due to the closeness necessary to disclose vulnerable or taboo dream content [43].
> Through dream sharing, dreams become a subject for collective sense-making, both between trusted contacts and within anonymous online communities.

### ON DREAM SHARING AND ITS PURPOSE

1. Protocols of dream sharing

    1. recounting the dream, and then asking someone to interpret it
    eg: I dreamt of gathering wheat under a full moon. Interpretation: you will be married within the year. 
    2. dreams are understood to be sites of action; not texts but places, not a coded language but a part of reality
    eg: 
        1. It may be that a key task—hunting, for example—is accomplished in dreams before it can be accomplished in waking life. Or it may be, as among the Wayuu of Colombia and Venezuela, that the trajectory of a dream is altered by being retold in waking life, with the expectation that the next night, the dream itself will change, and, as a result, the person’s waking life will too.5 (A similar technique has been pioneered by the therapist Barry Krakow to work with trauma victims: by writing down in a journal happier endings to their recurrent nightmares, the patients could tame them in sleep.)
        2. Dream life and waking life do not exist in a hermeneutic relation to one another—instead, they are interpenetrable and complementary planes of existence. Acting in one has an effect in the other—which in turn has an effect again in the first, and on and on in a continuous cycle.
        3. Animals had to be taken (or give themselves up) in dreams before they could be killed in waking life; indeed, the real hunt took place in dreams, and the waking hunt was only its fulfillment or realization.
    3. use dreaming to give shape to the substance and structure of their lives
        eg: Dreams show how the imagination mediates between perception and action, how it takes our experience of reality and directly transmutes it into a set of possible feelings, desires, and behaviors.
    4. socialized into waking life 
        eg： 
        1. Pandya explains that before going to bed, the Ongees narrated to one another their dreams from the night before, and their experiences of the day that had just ended, especially their time spent in the forest hunting and gathering food. But in doing so, they would negotiate the content of their dreams, modifying it so that everyone’s dream accounts might be gradually aligned with one another. One person might report having dreamt of fishing on the south beach of the island, another picking nuts on the west beach, then the first might suggest a compromise: We both went fishing in our dreams, but on the west beach.
        2. The indigenous explanation for this extraordinary process, Pandya reports, is as follows. During dreaming, the inner self leaves the outer self (the body) and travels the island in order to recuperate the bits of being that a person has lost during the day. These bits of being are most commonly manifest as stray smells, marooned on bushes and trees by the body during its daytime passage around the island. As the inner self collects these smells in the dream, it retraces the path of the body, collecting and consolidating important memories and making observations. The harvest of this inner being is then woven, over the sleeping “body external,” into a spider web that holds in place all the smells, dreams, and memories of previous nights and days, and so allows them to be used in the coming day. When the entire community talks through their dreams before sleeping, then the individual webs are woven together into a single web over the whole community. Pandya quotes a respected elder, Teemai: “To talk about the dreams and sing about the past makes a good spider web that connects all the open space to catch its food—it is a weave with all the lines woven well to let the spider know what is caught where. We, in remembering and dreaming, make a web for all individuals to gain.”
        
### Toward dream cartogaphy: mapping dream space and content

doi: 10.3138/cart.50.4.3137

**Abstract**
> The objective of dream cartography is to map dream content, that is, to develop new visualization methods and adapt existing ones as graphical means for an explorative dream analysis. We aim at modelling (i.e., disentangling), documenting, reuniting, and graphically depicting the dream space and other relevant psychological aspects of dreams in a meaningful but abstracted way. In this article we describe the proposed workflow for mapping dreams, focusing on data acquisition, and illustrate it with some proof-of-concept visualization examples. The dream space is fundamentally different from the real space, especially because it is not possible to consciously visit the place of the dream again. One way to address this setting issue is through data acquisition, and here we propose means for getting a more accurate description of the dream space and of other important dream elements.

**Insights**
1. to integrate all these visualization elements into an interactive Web platform, so that each dream presents itself to the map viewer in its actual multidimensionality
2. The  first  scientific  relevance  is  in cartography, since this  means exploring new,  undiscovered territories,  creating very specific, individual maps and proposing novel symbolization. The insights that we gain from  the  visualization  of  the spatial  dimension  of  dreams  may  be  used  to visually represent  other  data  or  descriptions  of  places,  as  the  surrounding  world  is interpreted by human cognition. The latter might  be used  in location-based services in order to improve for example verbal instructions for navigating to unknown places. [storytelling, brilliant]
3. Accordingly  we  can  provide  a  user-friendly,  graphical  tool  for  exploring  the dream storyline and landscape, allowing end-user to adapt the visualization in order to reflect the importance of the occurring elements in the dream
4. Dream Cartography c  serve  as  an  important  analysis  tool  for  psychologists  and  psychiatrists  who  may explore individual dreams and dream series of their patients for discovering patterns in the  dreams, such  as reoccurring  places, emotions,  type of  characters or  of social interactions.

### The landscape of Our Dream - Foundations of Dream Geography

### Dream Cartography. Mapping Dream Space and Content for an Exploratory Analysis of Dreams

doi: https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000381774

**Abstract**

Furthermore, a new type of Volunteered Geographical Information (VGI) is proposed: the fictional VGI (F-VGI). The social aspect of dreams is exploited, arguing that not only the dreamer, but also a third party may contribute to the fictional geography.

The dream setting is modelled, based on the systematic study of dream reports, on literature in dream psychology, geography and narratology, and on two empirical surveys. The first one is an online survey, with a convenience sample, answered by more than 300 persons and deals with general aspects of dream settings, such as what are elements, by which dreamers recognize a dream place. The second one is a paper-and-pencil survey, applied to an academic group com-posed of 30 cartography and geoinformation specialists. It contributes to the definition of the components of a setting. For example, one component is the dreamer’s familiarity with that place. This familiarity is used for building a straightforward model, which is the base for the place cookie diagram, visualized in form of concentric circles. In total, 26 dimensions are identified, which extensively characterize a setting. These dimensions are grouped into eight factors, which are: relation to geospace vs. role of space, society vs. morphology, individual vs. general exposure, and attention vs. environment. The obtained model is used to create a visual profile of the dream setting, named setting spider, in form of a radar chart with eight “legs”. Moreover, a similar model is built for a dream scene, resulting into the so-called event spider. The proposed profiles enable comparisons of different dream settings, or of different dreams, respectively. They can be used as uni- or multivariate point symbols on a thematic layer on top of a dream-land map. Additionally, the set-up of Web platform for mapping dreams is discussed and a functional prototype is implemented, featuring tools for data acquisition, for analyzing, graphical tools related to map creation and editing (e.g. map collage), and visualizations for different dream topics, such as picture frames for emotions or a graph-network for social interactions.

Finally, it is argued that the developed data models can be also adopted for real-life settings and events, therefore contributing to a better awareness of space in general, and acknowledging personal experiences as valuable for mapping real-life places. In a future continuation of this re-search, the application of such a dynamical model of the setting to real-life places could for ex-ample bring new insights for touristic places, or for spatial and settlement development in an urban environment.
