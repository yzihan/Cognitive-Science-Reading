### Are You Dreaming?: A Phenomenological Study on Understanding Lucid Dreams as a Tool for Introspection in Virtual Reality

doi: https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173917

> The ultimate VR might look like lucid dreaming, the phenomenon of knowing one is dreaming while in the dream.
> Lucid dreaming can be used as an introspective tool and, ultimately, increase mental well-being. What these introspective experiences are like for lucid dreamers might be key in determining specific design guidelines for future creation of a technological tool used for helping people examine their own thoughts and emotions.

### Real-time dialogue between experimenters and dreamers during REM sleep

> In each case, REM sleep was verified with standard polysomnographic methods, and sensory stimulation was used to convey questions to the dreaming participant. Many participants first produced a pre-arranged ocular response (a series of left-right eye signals) to indicate that they were experiencing a lucid dream. Importantly, our procedures involved training prior to sleep with the same type of sensory stimulation used during sleep. We also included training with response methods. 
> Lucid dreamers were able to follow instructions to compute mathematical operations, answer yes-or-no questions, or discriminate stimuli in the visual, tactile, and auditory modalities. They were able to respond using volitional control of gaze direction or of different facial muscles.

>IN (lower left) refers to methods whereby information was transmitted from experimenter to dreamer. OUT (lower right) refers to methods whereby information was transmitted from dreamer to experimenter. Examples of three dreams (color-coded for each input method) are illustrated below relevant excerpts from corresponding dream reports obtained following awakening. 
> Data in Figure 2 were obtained from a 19-year-old American participant who reported experiencing only two lucid dreams previously. He received sound cues during a 90-min daytime nap, near the beginning of a period of REM sleep. He indicated that he was in a lucid dream with a series of three left-right eye movements (termed LRLRLR). Then we presented a spoken math problem: 8 minus 6. Within 3 s, he responded with two left-right eye movements (LRLR) to signal the correct answer 2. The math problem was then repeated, and he again produced the correct answer.
