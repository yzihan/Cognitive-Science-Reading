Sleep is restorative from the cellular to the cognitive level. Sleep plays an active role in energy balance and metabolic processes throughout the brain and body, engaging in prophylactic care down to the single [105 106 107] neuron level. During sleep, your brain clears the neurotoxic waste products that accumulate in the nervous system duringtheday. Sleep is tied to an amazing 60% increase in the interstitial space between your cells, which creates an increase in exchange of cerebrospinal fluid with interstitial fluid: The brain goes through a kind of chemical car wash, making room between cell bodies to let waste be flushed from the brain. This lets us clear β-amyloid and tau, a peptide and protein called the ‘trigger and bullet’ in the genesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), at increased rates during the night. We use sleep to recover from the [108] hard work of processing daytime input, and the leftovers from these processes, to stay healthy. 

Of course, we not only need to recover from daytime input, we need to process and store it. Sleep exerts powerful effects on mechanisms of brain plasticity that govern initial learning of input and subsequent memoryconsolidation. At the molecular level, sleep elevates cortical messenger RNA levels of genes associated with protein synthesis, critical for building new synapses and strengthening existing ones. At [109] the synaptic level, information from the day is being rehearsed for storage in sleep, and patterns of brain activity expressed during training can be seen reappearing in subsequent REM and NREM sleep. Even cooler, the extent of learning during practice is correlated with the amount of reactivation during sleep. At the brain network level, as we sleep encoded information from the day undergoes a shift from storage based in short term representation (dependent on the hippocampus) to long term representation (spread throughout the neocortex). The hippocampus, which helps apprehend, bind and temporarily store information from the day, has a limited storage capacity. To clear storage in the night, pulses of neural activity, known as sharp-wave ripples and sleep spindles, travel between the hippocampus to the neocortex and carry information to long term storage. 

Clearing up short term storage creates both the consolidation of the original memory, and the post-sleep restoration and renewal of hippocampal encoding ability for new learning after awakening. This is why 111 participants subjected to one night of sleep loss, compared to those allowed to sleep, have twice as many episodic memory learning failures the next day. And this is why sleeping after learning, compared to 112 113 staying awake, offers a memory benefit of 20-40% ! Evenadaytimenapcanberestorative — learning capacity decreases across the day when we stay awake, but an afternoon nap creates a significant same-day enhancement in encoding ability. And if you were wondering, napping has been experimentally 114 proven to be superior to cramming for an exam.  115

Yet it’s not optimal to store everything we encounter during the day in long term memory — some information should be forgotten, and some should be distilled and integrated. Sleep has been shown to help us look for common patterns across memories and distill overarching rules, as well as simply stabilize the memoryexactly as it was learned. For example, subjects taught a rote method for solving math 116 problems for which there was also a shortcut (subjects were not told about it) were 2.6 times more likely to discover this shortcut after a period of sleep than an equal period of wake. The role of sleep in memory 117 formation is extensive and complex, beyond simple storage, and there’s much left to learn. Accordingly, the publication rate in the field of sleep and memory has doubled every 4-5 years since 1990.  118 

Amazingly, sleep even targets benefits where they are needed most: Intensive learning involving a specific brain region induces a local increase of slow wave activity (an EEG frequency band implicated in recovery sleep) in the very same region during sleep. This local increase after learning correlates with improved performance of a motor learning task after awakening. The brain thus marks areas of heavy local use, 119 120 likely using molecules like adenosine which indicate which cells have recently used energy, to later return during sleep for local recovery! And you can even have local naps: In humans, sleep restriction leads to intrusion of sleep into waking in the form of local sleep-like activity (local OFF periods in neuronal firing, like in slow wave activity) in an otherwise awake brain, causing specific, intermittent performance impairments .
