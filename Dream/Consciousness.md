### Dreaming as A Probe Into Consciousness 

The alterations in thought and behavior emergent in dreams can inform science in much the same way as alterations from brain damage have in the past. Patients with lesioned (damaged) brains, from HM to Phineas Gage, enabled many of the most important historical studies of the brain. Lesion studies tie brain function and physical substrate concretely, and are often thought to have been a prerequisite for the emergence of cognitive neuroscience. They point to ways that dynamic, interconnected brain networks 133 depend causally on the function of particular components. They reveal how cognition can be at least partially decomposed into modules. They show how degeneracy, in which many brain areas could subserve one function, comes into play in brain function. Lesion studies make it possible to tease apart a 134 criss-crossed connective system by eliminating pieces selectively and producing measurable behavioral effects.  

Yet lesions are not enough. Lesions cannot be reproduced for controlled study. Lesions cannot target specific neuronal groups in heterogeneous regions. Lesions give insight into the contribution of focal areas of brain tissue but rarely into the chemical contribution of brainwide neurotransmitters. Lesion studies cannot discriminate between the effects of destruction and disconnection, as the two come simultaneously with brain injury

Dreaming provides a remarkable experimental setting for a kind of repeatable lesion study on consciousness, happening every night in every bed in the world, as the chemical and physiological components of anotherwise integrated brain go offline in predictable fashion. We each exist during the day and reflect upon ourselves as an emergent, integrated whole “i” perceiving a continuous, integrated and boundworld. Yet sleep offers fractures in this continuous consciousness: the “i” undergoes major quantitative and qualitative changes as consciousness breaks down, and each crack reveals the lines where the functional puzzle pieces otherwise fit seamlessly together. Consciousness alters suddenly at sleep onset, at times an “i” with synesthesia, no concept of time, no sense of space, or even no sense of self (i.e. the dream without a dreamer ). Theconscious “i” often disappears during slow wave sleep, and suddenly re-emerges whole yet wholly different, hallucinatory and hyper-associative in typical REM dreams. Wetravel from pure perceptual experience to pure thought, from simple images to immersive stories, from being in cognitive command to loss of executive control and back again. And the bizarre but commonfeatures in normal dreams present striking similarities with neuropsychological symptoms observed in brain-damaged awake patients, suggesting specific commonalities in brain organisation and offering a more replicable avenue for study than lesions. Each of these experiences, from alterations in “i” 137 in N3todissociative experiences in REM, is an opportunity to link substrate to sensation with careful experimentation. 

Accordingly, probing the experience of dreams has been used today to test leading theories of consciousness and perception, from Tononi’s Integrated Information Theory to Friston’s Free Energy Principle and Predictive Processing, investigating models of consciousness posed long ago by Helmholtz and Kant andBayes. Tononishowedtheprecuneus,posterior cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices may be 139 a core correlate of consciousness by studying dream phenomenology: in both NREM and REM sleep, reports of dream experience were associated with local decreases in low-frequency activity in these areas, and monitoring this zone in real time predicted whether an individual reported dreaming or the absence of dreamexperiences during NREM sleep. Electrical stimulation of this area, in turn, produces a feeling of 140 141 being in a ‘parallel world’ or a ‘dream-like state’. 100 years before this work, Leaning examined the hypnagogic state and noted the seeing of faces is so widespread among the hypnagogic imagers that it “almost suggests that there is a special ‘face-seeing’ propensity in the mind”. This hypothesis, based 142 solely on the study of the experience of sleep onset dreams, has now been supported by fMRI work and constitutes some of the first convincing evidence for anatomical specificity of brain function, as well as a key area in the study of predictive perceptual processing. The experience of dreaming in particular, and 143 the subjective reports of dreams, have offered key experimental insight into consciousness.
