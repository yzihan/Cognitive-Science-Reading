## Neural Correlates of Dream

This is an example of how researchers found neural correlates of specific dream content

Another example using a similar method with EEG

In both of these cases, they woke people up, asked them about their dream content, and then correlated that with the brain signals.

This is an example where they first recorded the neural response to a sound in wake, and then found the same response in the sleep EEG

This is another approach to decoding content using the P300. Basically you present stimuli (using sound, I gues if the person is sleeping) and the brain generates a P300 response if the stimulus is relevant. I'm not sure how well this would actually work for dreams though

### The neural correlates of dreaming

nature neuroscience: https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4545

>Consciousness never fades during waking. However, when awakened from sleep, we sometimes recall dreams and sometimes recall no experiences. Traditionally, dreaming has been identified with rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep, characterized by wake-like, globally 'activated', high-frequency electroencephalographic activity. However, dreaming also occurs in non-REM (NREM) sleep, characterized by prominent low-frequency activity. This challenges our understanding of the neural correlates of conscious experiences in sleep. Using high-density electroencephalography, we contrasted the presence and absence of dreaming in NREM and REM sleep. In both NREM and REM sleep, reports of dream experience were associated with local decreases in low-frequency activity in posterior cortical regions. High-frequency activity in these regions correlated with specific dream contents. Monitoring this posterior 'hot zone' in real time predicted whether an individual reported dreaming or the absence of dream experiences during NREM sleep, suggesting that it may constitute a core correlate of conscious experiences in sleep.



### Variations in EEG Coherence as an Index of the Affective Content of Dreams from REM Sleep: Relationships with Face Imagery

> EEG coherence was examined in relation to four measures of socioemotional dream content, including a new measure—the proportional representation of a character's face. Twenty-four healthy subjects, recorded for sleep stages and EEG activity, were awakened from REM sleep to report dream mentation and to rate it on these variables. Coherence scores were calculated for homologous interhemispheric electrode pairs (Fp1–Fp2, F3–F4, F7–F8, C3–C4, P3–P4, O1–O2, T3–T4, T5–T6) and for left and right intrahemispheric pairs for delta, theta, alpha, beta1, and beta2 frequencies. These were correlated with the mentation measures. Positive correlations were found between average interhemispheric coherence in most bands and the character face measure. A breakdown by gender revealed that this relationship was most evident for women, whereas for men positive correlations were observed between coherence and negative self-feeling. That similar relationships also obtained for both left and right intrahemispheric coherence is consistent with the hypothesis that dreamed socioemotional interactions reflect the integrative functioning of many brain regions in both hemispheres.



### Identification of memory reactivation during sleep by EEG classification

abstract

> Memory reactivation during sleep is critical for consolidation, but also extremely difficult to measure as it is subtle, distributed and temporally unpredictable. This article reports a novel method for detecting such reactivation in standard sleep recordings. During learning, participants produced a complex sequence of finger presses, with each finger cued by a distinct audio-visual stimulus. Auditory cues were then re-played during subsequent sleep to trigger neural reactivation through a method known as targeted memory reactivation (TMR). Next, we used electroencephalography data from the learning session to train a machine learning classifier, and then applied this classifier to sleep data to determine how successfully each tone had elicited memory reactivation. Neural reactivation was classified above chance in all participants when TMR was applied in SWS, and in 5 of the 14 participants to whom TMR was applied in N2. Classification success reduced across numerous repetitions of the tone cue, suggesting either a gradually reducing responsiveness to such cues or a plasticity-related change in the neural signature as a result of cueing. We believe this method will be valuable for future investigations of memory consolidation.
