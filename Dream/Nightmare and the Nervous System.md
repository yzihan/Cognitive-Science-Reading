Overview

> In the world of trauma therapy, a paradigm shift has been taking place over the past decade or so, a marked shift toward embodied and somatic approaches to the understanding and healing of trauma. The polyvagal theory by Dr. Stephen Porges has led clinicians to consider that much of what was previously viewed as pathological behaviour can be seen as adaptive responses that our client’s autonomic nervous systems (ANS) have initiated as a means of protection and survival. This hopeful and non-shaming approach has changed the way trauma therapy is practiced for so many… yet the paradigm shift has not found its way into the treatment of nightmares.

Takeaway

> Nightmares reflect a nervous system that doesn’t feel safe. People's pathway to safety and recovery, however, is different. 

### Somatic Experiencing Therapy

Overview

> Somatic Experiencing (SE) therapy is a powerful method for resolving trauma symptoms and relieving chronic stress.  Developed by Dr. Peter Levine, SE results from his multidisciplinary study of stress physiology, psychology, ethology, biology, neuroscience, indigenous healing practices, and medical biophysics, and decades of successful clinical application.

> Dr. Levine found that prey animals in the wild rarely become traumatized, despite routine threats to their lives. Yet he observed human beings become readily traumatized. He noted that mammals automatically regulate survival responses through the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Further, he saw that under threat, massive amounts of energy are mobilized in readiness for fight, flight, freeze, and collapse responses. Once safe, animals spontaneously “discharge” this excess energy through involuntary movements like shaking, trembling, and deep breaths. This discharge process resets the ANS, readying it for the next threat. Since humans and other animals possess nearly identical brain- and body-based survival mechanisms, Dr. Levine theorized that human beings get PTSD because of overriding this mammalian discharge response.
