How do we search for the meaning of our dreams on Google? We have explored the related queries to the question **What does it mean to dream about** in different languages to see which dream subjects users look for most. We discovered that we share some recurring dreams.



### EEG Based Artistic Visualization of Dreams

Chinese CHI'21

> The research on dreams in modern times mainly includes the psychoanalytic school represented by Freud and the modern sleep science based on EEG signals and physiological indicators. The publication of "Analysis of Dreams" by the Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud marked the beginning of asystematic exploration of dreams in the modern sense [1]. He reduced the essence of dreams to "satisfaction of desires." Carl Gustav Jung further elaborated on Freud’s point of view, that dreams are partial close-ups of people’s complex mental activities [2]. In the late 1950s, with the rise of cognitive science and neurobiology, the interpretation of dream content was replaced by scientific experimentalist theories. Nathaniel Kleitman and his student Eugene Aserinsky discovered the regular cycle of sleep (REM) At the same time, it proved that "rapid eye movement" is related to the general increase in dreaming and brain activity, which has greatly promoted the progress of dream research [3]. Subsequent experiments by Kleitman and William C. Dement found that the electrical activity of the brain measured by EEG in the REM phase is very similar to the active saccade of the waking eyes, and there is a high correlation between rapid eye movement sleep and dreaming (0.80 correlation coefficient). The instrument testing is introduced into sleep and dream testing [4].

### Our dreams, our selves: automatic analysis of dream reports

https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.192080

> Sleep scientists have shown that dreaming helps people improve their waking lives, and they have done so by developing sophisticated content analysis scales. 
>
> Dream analysis entails time-consuming manual annotation of text. That is why dream reports have been recently mined with algorithms, and these algorithms focused on identifying emotions. 
>
> In so doing, researchers have not tackled two main technical challenges though: 
>
> > (i) how to mine aspects of dream reports that research has found important, such as characters and interactions; 
> >
> > and (ii) how to do so in a principled way grounded in the literature. 

> To tackle these challenges, we designed a tool that automatically scores dream reports by operationalizing the widely used dream analysis scale by Hall and Van de Castle. 
>
> We validated the tool’s effectiveness on hand-annotated dream reports (the average error is 0.24), scored 24 000 reports—far more than any previous study—and tested what sleep scientists call the ‘continuity hypothesis’ at this unprecedented scale: we found supporting evidence that dreams are a continuation of what happens in everyday life. 
>
> Our results suggest that it is possible to quantify important aspects of dreams, making it possible to build technologies that bridge the current gap between real life and dreaming.

>Research has repeatedly provided strong support for what sleep scientists refer to as the ‘continuity hypothesis of dreams’: most dreams are a continuation of what is happening in everyday life. It turns out that everyday life impacts dreaming (e.g. anxiety in life leads to dreams with negative affect) [[1](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C1),[2](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C2)], and vice versa (e.g. dreaming impacts problem-solving skills) [[3](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C3),[4](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C4)].

>In the therapeutic context, the main goal of dream analysis is to help people address their real-life problems. This hypothesis provides a theoretical basis for therapy as it can be used to raise self-awareness, to identify latent emotional states, and to help people cope with significant life events and traumas. Given that, dream analysis is used to address many mental health issues. For those suffering from nightmares, interpreting dreams and ultimately influencing them are ways of partly treat their condition. To see how, consider the concept of lucid dreaming. A lucid dream is one in which the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming, and can control their actions [[5](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C5)]. For such dreams, being able to interpret them translates into being able to influence them, and such an ability is often used as a treatment: therapies based on lucid dreaming have repeatedly been found to be effective in reducing nightmare frequency [[6](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C6)–[8](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C8)]. In contemporary therapy, imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT) is often used [[9](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C9)]: therapists ask their clients to recall their bad dreams, write them down and then change their content to something positive, encouraging their clients to mentally rehearse these new dream scripts every day to decrease the frequency and intensity of the nightmares.

>More generally, dream interpretation is one tool that has been used by therapists for a long time [[5](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C5),[10](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C10)–[14](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C14)]. For example, it has been used for exploring wish fulfillment, unconscious desires and conflicts (in Freudian and Jungian analyses), and for bringing dream content into a client’s actual life, helping the client clarify feelings from all angles (in Gestalt therapy).

>Because dream interpretation helps people improve their waking lives, sleep scientists have developed increasingly sophisticated ways of coding dreams. Winget & Kramer reviewed 150 dream rating and content analysis scales [[15](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C15)], and found that the best validated and most widely used scale remains Hall & Van de Castle’s [[16](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C16),[17](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192080#RSOS192080C17)].

### DancingWords: exploring animated word clouds to tell stories

doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12650-020-00689-0

**Abstract**

>By encoding semantic relations into relative positions, word clouds have shown the capability to deliver richer messages than purely visualizing word frequencies. Existing studies mainly focus on layout algorithms that cluster related words, preserve temporal coherence, and optimize spatial shapes. However, they cannot fully convey multiple relations among words and their evolvement through relative positions and static representations. In this paper, we explore animated word clouds that take advantage of storytelling strategies to present interactions between words and show the dynamic process of content changes, thus communicating the underlying stories. We initially create several exemplars of animated word clouds with designers through a structured iterative design process. These exemplars lead to a preliminary design space that distills essential narrative elements with design choices. Based on the design space, we develop a prototype tool, DancingWords, which provides story-oriented interactions and automatic layouts for users to generate animated word clouds. We evaluate the expressiveness and usefulness of our system through several example animated stories and a usability study with general users. The results show that DancingWords allows users to produce appealing storytelling videos easily and quickly for communication.


### My Virtual Dream’: Collective Neurofeedback in an Immersive Art Environment

doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0130129

**Abstract**

> While human brains are specialized for complex and variable real world tasks, most neuroscience studies reduce environmental complexity, which limits the range of behaviours that can be explored. Motivated to overcome this limitation, we conducted a large-scale experiment with electroencephalography (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) technology as part of an immersive multi-media science-art installation. Data from 523 participants were collected in a single night. The exploratory experiment was designed as a collective computer game where players manipulated mental states of relaxation and concentration with neurofeedback targeting modulation of relative spectral power in alpha and beta frequency ranges. Besides validating robust time-of-night effects, gender differences and distinct spectral power patterns for the two mental states, our results also show differences in neurofeedback learning outcome. The unusually large sample size allowed us to detect unprecedented speed of learning changes in the power spectrum (~ 1 min). Moreover, we found that participants' baseline brain activity predicted subsequent neurofeedback beta training, indicating state-dependent learning. Besides revealing these training effects, which are relevant for BCI applications, our results validate a novel platform engaging art and science and fostering the understanding of brains under natural conditions.
