## Techniques for Dream

### Dream engineering: Simulating worlds through sensory stimulation

doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2020.102955

**Abstract**

> We explore the application of a wide range of sensory stimulation technologies to the area of sleep and dream engineering. We begin by emphasizing the causal role of the body in dream generation, and describe a circuitry between the sleeping body and the dreaming mind. We suggest that nearly any [sensory stimuli](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/sensory-stimulus) has potential for modulating experience in sleep. Considering other areas that might afford tools for engineering sensory content in simulated worlds, we turn to Virtual Reality (VR). We outline a collection of relevant VR technologies, including devices engineered to stimulate haptic, temperature, vestibular, olfactory, and auditory sensations. We believe these technologies, which have been developed for high mobility and low cost, can be translated to the field of dream engineering. We close by discussing possible future directions in this field and the ethics of a world in which targeted dream direction and sleep manipulation are feasible.



### Dormio: Interfacing with Dreams

**Inspiration**

> Sleep is a forgotten country of the mind. A vast majority of our technologies are built for our waking state, even though a third of our lives are spent asleep. Current technological interfaces miss an opportunity to access the unique, imaginative, elastic cognition ongoing during dreams and semi-lucid states. In turn, each of us misses an opportunity to use interfaces to influence our own processes of memory consolidation, creative insight generation, gist extraction, and emotion regulation that are so deeply sleep-dependent. In this project, we explore ways to augment human creativity by extending, influencing, and capturing dreams in Stage 1 sleep. It is currently impossible to force ourselves to be creative because so much creative idea association and creative incubation happens in the absence of executive control and directed attention. Sleep offers an opportunity for prompting creative thought in the absence of directed attention, if only dreams can be controlled.


### Dormio: A targeted dream incubation device

**Abstract**
>Information processing during sleep is active, ongoing and accessible to engineering. Protocols such as targeted memory reactivation use sensory stimuli during sleep to reactivate memories and demonstrate subsequent, specific enhancement of their consolidation. These protocols rely on physiological, as opposed to phenomenological, evidence of their reactivation. While dream content can predict post-sleep memory enhancement, dreaming itself remains a black box. Here, we present a novel protocol using a new wearable electronic device, Dormio, to automatically generate serial auditory dream incubations at sleep onset, wherein targeted information is repeatedly presented during the hypnagogic period, enabling direct incorporation of this information into dream content, a process we call targeted dream incubation (TDI). Along with validation data, we discuss how Dormio and TDI protocols can serve as tools for controlled experimentation on dream content, shedding light on the role of dreams in the overnight transformation of experiences into memories.

> The aim of the current study is to assess the ability of Dormio to identify the sleep onset period and successfully manipulate the content of hypnagogic dream report through pre-sleep verbal prompts

**Methods**
>1. The user interaction with the Dormio system occurs across multiple <b>stages of consciousness including wake, sleep onset, sleep, and hypnopompic wake</b>.
>2. This can range from <b>a creative problem they are working on to an experience they want to reflect on or an emotional issue they want to develop a new perspective on.</b>
>3. Hori and colleagues have defined nine substages of sleep onset (Hori et al., 1994) based on electroencephalographic (EEG) changes, leaving the line between wake and sleep blurry. The current version of Dormio aims simply to detect the sleep onset period (SOP), without making claims of identifying specific Hori stages or the exact moment of sleep onset.
>4. The wording of instructions given to participants in administering sleep and dream studies is crucial, especially given that participants are in periods of semi-wake when executive control is transient, metacognitive ability is declining, and dream amnesia after waking is common. </br> 
Main difference:</br> 
Remember to think of a Tree </br>
Remember to observe your thoughts

**Limitations**
>1. age range of participants: all are university-affiliated, yielding a somewhat homogenous population. 
>2. subjective report

**Problems**
>Correlational studies linking dream incorporation and memory consolidation leave two important questions unanswered. 
>1. The first of these is whether there is a causal link between the two. [solved]
>2. In their 2010 paper, Wamsley and colleagues concluded, “it is not our contention that dream experiences cause memory consolidation during sleep. Instead, … dreaming may be a reflection of the brain processes supporting sleep-dependent memory processing” [may solved]
